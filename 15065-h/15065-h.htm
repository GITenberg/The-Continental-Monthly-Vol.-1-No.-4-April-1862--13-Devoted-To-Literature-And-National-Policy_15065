<h2>The War Between Freedom And Slavery In Missouri.</h2>


<p>It is admitted that no man can write
the history of his own times with such
fullness and impartiality as shall entitle
his record to the unquestioning credence
and acceptance of posterity. Men are
necessarily actors in the scenes amid
which they live. If not personally taking
an active part in the conduct of
public affairs, they have friends who
are, and in whose success or failure their
own welfare is in some way bound up.
The bias which interest always gives
will necessarily attach to their judgment
of current events, and the leading actors
by whom these events are controlled.
Cotemporaneous history, for this reason,
will always be found partisan history&mdash;not
entitled to, and, if intelligently and
honestly written, not exacting, the implicit
faith of those who shall come after;
but simply establishing that certain
classes of people, of whom the writer
was one, acted under the conviction
that they owed certain duties to themselves
and their country. It will be for
the future compiler of the world's history,
who shall see the end of present
struggles, to determine the justice of the
causes of controversy, and the wisdom
and honesty of the parties that acted
adversely. To such after judgment,
with a full knowledge of present reproach
as a partisan, the writer of this
article commends the brief sketch he
will present of the beginning and military
treatment of the great Rebellion in
the State of Missouri. He will not attempt
to make an episode of any part
of this history, because of the supposed
vigor or brilliancy of the martial deeds
occurring in the time. Least of all
would he take the 'Hundred Days,'
which another pen has chosen for special
distinction, as representing the period
of heroism in that war-trampled
State. Any 'hundred days' of the rebellion
in Missouri have had their corresponding

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">nights</span>; and no one can be
bold enough yet to say that the day of
permanent triumph has dawned. Humiliation
has alternated with success so
far; and the most stunning defeats of
the war in the West marked the beginning
and the close of the hundred days
named for honor. This fact should teach
modesty and caution. For while justice
to men requires us to admit that the
greatest abilities do not always command
success, devotion to principle forbids
that a noble cause should be obscured
to become the mere background
of a scene in which an actor and popular
idol is the chief figure. It is with a
consciousness of such partialities as are

common to men, but with an honest purpose,
so far as the writer is able, to subordinate
men to principles, that this review
of the origin and chief incidents of
the rebellion in Missouri is begun.</p>

<p>The close connection of the State of
Missouri with the slavery agitation that
has now ripened into a rebellion against
the government of the United States, is
a singular historical fact. The admission
of the State into the Union was
the occasion of vitalizing the question of
slavery extension and fixing it as a permanent
element in the politics of the
country. It has continued to be the
theatre on which the most important
conflicts growing out of slavery extension
have been decided. It will be the
first, in the hope and belief of millions,
to throw off the fetters of an obsolete
institution, so long cramping its social
and political advancement, and to set
an example to its sister slave-holding
States of the superior strength, beauty,
and glory of Freedom.</p>

<p>The pro-slavery doctrines of John C.
Calhoun, after having pervaded the democracy
of all the other slave-holding
States, and obtained complete possession
of the national executive, legislative
and judicial departments, finally, in
1844, appeared also in the State of Missouri.
But it was in so minute and subtle
a form as not to seem a sensible heresy.
Thomas H. Benton, the illustrious
senator of the Jackson era, was then, as
he had been for twenty-four years, the
political autocrat of Missouri. He had
long been convinced of the latent treason
of the Calhoun school of politicians.
He was able to combat the schemes
of the Southern oligarchy composing
and controlling the Cabinet of President
Polk; unsuccessfully, it is true, yet with
but slight diminution of his popularity
at home. Nevertheless, the seeds of disunion
had been borne to his State; they
had taken root; and, like all evil in life,
they proved self-perpetuating and ineradicable.
In 1849 the Mexican war,
begun in the interest of the disunionists,
had been closed. A vast accession of
territory had accrued to the Union. It
was the plan and purpose of the disunion
party to appropriate and occupy
this territory; to organize it in their interests;
and, finally, to admit it into the
Union as States, to add to their political
power, and prepare for that struggle between
the principle of freedom and the
principle of slavery in the government,
which Mr. Calhoun had taught was inevitable.
But the hostility of Benton in
the Senate was dreaded by the Southern
leaders thus early conspiring against the
integrity of the Union. The Missouri
senator seemed, of all cotemporaneous
statesmen, to be the only one that fully
comprehended the incipient treason.
His earnest opposition assumed at times
the phases of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">monomania</span>. He sought
to crush it in the egg. He lifted his
warning voice on all occasions. He inveighed
bitterly against the 'Nullifiers,'
as he invariably characterized the Calhoun
politicians, declaring that their
purpose was to destroy the Union. It
became necessary, therefore, before attempting
to dispose of the territories
acquired from Mexico, to silence Benton,
or remove him from the Senate.
Accordingly, when the legislature of
Missouri met in 1849, a series of resolutions
was introduced, declaring that all
territory derived by the United States,
in the treaty with Mexico, should be
open to settlement by the citizens of all
the States in common; that the question
of allowing or prohibiting slavery
in any territory could only be decided
by the people resident in the territory,
and then only when they came to organize
themselves into a State government;
and, lastly, that if the general
government should attempt to establish
a rule other than this for the settlement
of the territories, the State of Missouri
would stand pledged to her sister Southern
States to co-operate in whatever
measures of resistance or redress <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">they</span>
might deem necessary. The resolutions
distinctly abdicated all right of judgment
on the part of Missouri, and committed
the State to a blind support of
Southern 'Nullification' in a possible
contingency. They were in flagrant

opposition to the life-long principles and
daily vehement utterances of Benton&mdash;as
they were intended to be. Nevertheless,
they were adopted; and the
senators of Missouri were instructed to
conform their public action to them.
These resolutions were introduced by
one Claiborne F. Jackson, a member
of the House of Representatives from
the County of Howard, one of the
most democratic and largest slave-holding
counties in the State. The resolutions
took the name of their mover, and
are known in the political history of Missouri
as the 'Jackson resolutions.' And
Claiborne F. Jackson, who thus took the
initiative in foisting treason upon the
statute-books of Missouri, is, to-day, by
curious coincidence, the official head of
that State nominally in open revolt.
But Jackson, it was early ascertained,
was not entitled to the doubtful honor
of the paternity of these resolutions.
They had been matured in a private
chamber of the Capitol at Jefferson
City, by two or three conspirators, who
received, it was asserted by Benton, and
finally came to be believed, the first
draft of the resolutions from Washington,
where the disunion cabal, armed
with federal power, had its headquarters.</p>

<p>Thus the bolt was launched at the
Missouri senator, who, from his prestige
of Jacksonism, his robust patriotism, his
indomitable will, and his great abilities,
was regarded as the most formidable
if not the only enemy standing in
the way of meditated treason. It was
not doubted that the blow would be fatal.
Benton was in one sense the father
of the doctrine of legislative instructions.
In his persistent and famous efforts to
'expunge' the resolutions of censure on
Gen. Jackson that had been placed in
the Senate journal, Benton had found
it necessary to revolutionize the sentiments
or change the composition of the
Senate. Whigs were representing democratic
States, and Democrats refused to
vote for a resolution expunging any part
of the record of the Senate's proceedings.
To meet and overcome this resistance,
Benton introduced the dogma
that a senator was bound to obey the
instructions of the legislature of his
State. He succeeded, by his great influence
in his party, and by the aid of
the democratic administration, in having
the dogma adopted, and it became an
accepted rule in the democratic party.
Resolutions were now invoked and obtained
from State legislatures instructing
their senators to vote for the 'Expunging
Resolutions,' or resign. Some
obeyed; some resigned. Benton carried
his point; but it was at the sacrifice of
the spirit of that part of the Constitution
which gave to United States senators
a term of six years, for the purpose
of protecting the Senate from frequent
fluctuations of popular feeling,
and securing steadiness in legislation.
Benton was the apostle of this unwise
and destructive innovation upon the
constitutional tenure of senators. He
was doomed to be a conspicuous victim
of his own error. When the 'Jackson
resolutions' were passed by the legislature
of Missouri, instructing Benton to
endorse measures that led to nullification
and disunion, he saw the dilemma
in which he was placed, and did the best
he could to extricate himself. He presented
the resolutions from his seat in
the Senate; denounced their treasonable
character, and declared his purpose to
appeal from the legislature to the people
of Missouri.</p>

<p>On the adjournment of Congress,
Benton returned to Missouri and commenced
a canvass in vindication of his
own cause, and in opposition to the democratic
majority of the legislature that
passed the Jackson resolutions, which
has had few if any parallels in the history
of the government for heat and bitterness.
The senator did not return to
argue and convert, but to fulminate and
destroy. He appointed times and places
for public speaking in the most populous
counties of the State, and where the opposition
to him had grown boldest. He
allowed no 'division of time' to opponents
wishing to controvert the positions
assumed in his speeches. On the contrary,

he treated every interruption,
whether for inquiry or retort, on the
part of any one opposed to him, as an
insult, and proceeded to pour upon the
head of the offender a torrent of denunciation
and abuse, unmeasured and
appalling. The extraordinary course
adopted by Benton in urging his 'appeal,'

excited astonishment and indignation
among the democratic partisans
that had, in many cases, thoughtlessly
become arrayed against him.<a href="#note_1"><span class="footnoteref">1</span></a> They
might have yielded to expostulation;
they were stung to resentment by unsparing
vilification. The rumor of Benton's
manner preceded him through the
State, after the first signal manifestations
of his ruthless spirit; and he was
warned not to appear at some of the appointments
he had made, else his life
would pay the forfeit of his personal assaults.
These threats only made the
Missouri lion more fierce and untamable.
He filled all his appointments,
bearing everywhere the same front, often
surrounded by enraged enemies
armed and thirsting for his blood, but
ever denunciatory and defiant, and returned
to St. Louis, still boiling with
inexhaustible choler, to await the judgment
of the State upon his appeal. He
failed. The pro-slavery sentiment of the
people had been too thoroughly evoked
in the controversy, and too many valuable
party leaders had been needlessly
driven from his support by unsparing invective.
An artful and apparently honest
appeal to the right of legislative instructions,&mdash;an
enlargement of popular
rights which Benton himself had conferred
upon them,&mdash;and&mdash;the unfailing
weapon of Southern demagogues against
their opponents&mdash;the charge that Benton
had joined the 'Abolitionists,' and
was seeking to betray 'the rights of the
South,' worked the overthrow of the hitherto
invincible senator. The Whigs of
Missouri, though agreeing mainly with
Benton in the principles involved in
this contest, had received nothing at his
hands, throughout his long career, but
defeat and total exclusion from all offices
and honors, State and National. This
class of politicians were too glad of the
prospective division of his party and the
downfall of his power, to be willing to
re-assert their principles through a support
of Benton. The loyal Union sentiments
of the State in this way failed to
be united, and a majority was elected to
the legislature opposed to Benton. He
was defeated of a re-election to the Senate
by Henry S. Geyer, a pro-slavery
Whig, and supporter of the Jackson resolutions,
after having filled a seat in that
august body for a longer time consecutively
than any other senator ever did.
Thus was removed from the halls of
Congress the most sagacious and formidable
enemy that the disunion propagandists
ever encountered. Their career in
Congress and in the control of the federal
government was thenceforth unchecked.
The cords of loyalty in Missouri
were snapped in Benton's fall, and
that State swung off into the strongly-sweeping
current of secessionism. The
city of St. Louis remained firm a while,
and returned Benton twice to the
House; but his energies were exhausted
now in defensive war; and the truculent
and triumphant slave power dominating,
the State at last succeeded, through the

coercion of commercial interests, in defeating
him even in the citadel of loyalty.
He tried once more to breast the
tide that had borne down his fortunes.
He became a candidate for governor in
1856; but, though he disclaimed anti-slavery
sentiments, and supported James
Buchanan for President against Fremont,
his son-in-law, he was defeated by
Trusten Polk, who soon passed from the
gubernatorial chair to Benton's seat in
the United States Senate, from which
he was, in course of time, to be expelled.
Benton retired to private life,
only to labor more assiduously in compiling
historical evidences against the
fast ripening treason of the times.</p>

<p>The Missouri senator was no longer in
the way of the Southern oligarchs. A
shaft feathered by his own hands&mdash;the
doctrine of instructions&mdash;had slain him.</p>

<p>But yet another obstacle remained.
The Missouri Compromise lifted a barrier
to the expansion of the Calhoun idea
of free government, having African slavery
for its corner-stone. This obstacle
was to be removed. Missouri furnished
the prompter and agent of that wrong in
David E. Atchison, for many years Benton's
colleague in the Senate. Atchison
was a man of only moderate talents,
of dogged purpose, willful, wholly unscrupulous
in the employment of the influences
of his position, and devoid of all
the attributes and qualifications of statesmanship.
He was a fit representative
of the pro-slavery fanaticism of his
State; had lived near the Kansas line;
had looked upon and coveted the fair
lands of that free territory, and resolved
that they should be the home and appanage
of slavery. It is now a part of
admitted history, that this dull but determined
Missouri senator approached
Judge Douglas, then chairman of the
Committee on Territories, and, by some
incomprehensible influence, induced that
distinguished senator to commit the flagrant
and terrible blunder of reporting
the Kansas-Nebraska bill, with a clause
repealing the Missouri Compromise, and
thus throwing open Kansas to the occupation
of slavery. That error was grievously
atoned for in the subsequent hard
fate of Judge Douglas, who was cast off
and destroyed by the cruel men he had
served. Among the humiliations that
preceded the close of this political tragedy,
none could have been more pungent
to Judge Douglas than the fact that
Atchison, in a drunken harangue from
the tail of a cart in Western Missouri,
surrounded by a mob of 'border ruffians'
rallying for fresh wrongs upon the free
settlers of Kansas, recited, in coarse glee
and brutal triumph, the incidents of his
interview with the senator of Illinois,
when, with mixed cajolery and threats,
he partly tempted, partly drove him to
his ruin. The Kansas-Nebraska bill was
passed. What part Atchison took, what
part Missouri took, under the direction
of the pro-slavery leaders that filled
every department of the State government,
the 'border-ruffian' forays, the pillage
of the government arsenal at Liberty,
the embargo of the Missouri river,
and the robbing and mobbing of peaceful
emigrants from the free States, the
violence at the polls, and the fraudulent
voting that corrupted all the franchises
of that afflicted territory, do sufficiently
attest. It is not needed to rehearse any
of this painful and well-known history.</p>

<p>The Territory of Kansas was saved
to its prescriptive freedom. The slavery
propagandists sullenly withdrew and
gave up the contest. The last days of
the dynasty that had meditated the conquest
of the continent to slave-holding
government were evidently at hand.
The result of the struggle in Kansas had
reversed the relation of the contesting
powers. The oligarchs, who had always
before been aggressive, and intended to
subordinate the Union to slavery, or
destroy it, found themselves suddenly
thrown on the defensive; and, with the
quick intelligence of a property interest,
and the keen jealousy of class and caste
which their slave-holding had implanted,
they saw that they were engaged in an
unequal struggle, that their sceptre was
broken, and that, if they continued to
rule, it would have to be over the homogeneous
half of a dismembered Union.

From this moment a severance of the
Slave States from the Free was resolved
on, and every agency that could operate
on governments, State and National, was
set to work. It was not by accident that
Virginia had procured the nomination
of the facile Buchanan for President in
the Baltimore Convention of 1856; it
was not by accident that Floyd was
made Secretary of War, or that, many
months before any outbreak of rebellion,
this arch traitor had well-nigh stripped
the Northern arsenals of arms, and
placed them where they would be 'handy'

for insurgents to seize. It was not
by accident that John C. Breckenridge
headed the factionists that willfully divided
and defeated the National Democracy,
that perchance could have elected
Judge Douglas President; nor was it by
accident that Beriah Magoffin, a vain,
weak man, the creature, adjunct, and
echo of Breckenridge, filled the office of
governor of Kentucky, nominated thereto
by Breckenridge's personal intercession.
And lastly, to return to the special
theatre of this sketch, it was not by
accident that Claiborne F. Jackson, the
original mover for Benton's destruction,
was at this remarkable juncture found
occupying the governor's chair, with
Thomas C. Reynolds for his lieutenant
governor, a native of South Carolina,
an acknowledged missionary of the nullification
faith to a State that required to
be corrupted, and that he had, during
his residence, zealously endeavored to
corrupt.</p>

<p>We have now reached the turning
point in the history of Missouri. The
State is about to be plunged into the
whirlpool of civil war. Undisguised disunionists
are in complete possession of
the State government, and the population
is supposed to be ripe for revolt.
Only one spot in it, and that the city
of St. Louis, is regarded as having the
slightest sympathy with the political sentiments
of the Free States of the Union.
The State is surely counted for the
'South' in the division that impends,
for where is the heart in St. Louis bold
enough, or the hand strong enough, to
resist the swelling tide of pro-slavery fanaticism
that was about to engulf the
State? Years ago, when it was but a
ripple on the surface, it had overborne
Benton, with all his fame of thirty years'
growth. What leader of slighter mold
and lesser fame could now resist the
coming shock? In tracing the origin
and growth of rebellion in Missouri, it is
interesting to gather up all the threads
that link the present with the past. It
will preserve the unity of the plot, and
give effect to the last acts of the drama.</p>

<p>The first visible seam or cleft in the
National Democratic party occurred
during the administration of President
Polk, in the years 1844-48. Calhoun
appeared as Polk's Secretary of State.
Thomas Ritchie was transferred from
Richmond, Va., to Washington, to edit
the government organ, in place of Francis
P. Blair, Sr. The Jackson <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">regime</span>

of unconditional and uncompromising
devotion to the 'Federal Union' was
displaced, and the dubious doctrine of
'States' Rights' was formally inaugurated
as the chart by which in future the
national government was to be administered.
But the Jackson element was
not reconciled to this radical change in
the structure and purpose of the National
Democratic organization; and, although
party lines were so tensely drawn
that to go against 'the Administration'
was political treason, and secured irrevocable
banishment from power, the
close of Polk's administration found
many old Democrats of the Jackson era
ready for the sacrifice. The firm resolve
of these men was manifested when, after
the nomination of Gen. Cass, in 1848, in
the usual form, at Baltimore, by the
Democratic National Convention, they
assembled at Buffalo and presented a
counter ticket, headed by the name of
Martin Van Buren, who had been thrust
aside four years previously by the Southern
oligarchs to make way for James K.
Polk. The entire artillery of the Democratic
party opened on the Buffalo schismatics.
They were stigmatized by such
opprobrious nicknames and epithets as
'Barnburners, 'Free Soilers,' 'Abolitionists,'

and instantly and forever ex-communicated
from the Democratic party.
In Missouri alone, of all the Slave
States, was any stand made in behalf of
the Buffalo ticket. Benton's sympathies
had been with Van Buren, his old friend
of the Jackson times; and Francis P.
Blair, Sr., of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Globe</span>, had two sons,
Montgomery Blair and Francis P. Blair,
Jr., resident in St. Louis. These two,
with about a hundred other young men
of equal enthusiasm, organized themselves
together, accepted the 'Buffalo
platform' as their future rule of faith,
issued an address to the people of Missouri,
openly espousing and advocating
free soil-principles; and, by subscription
among themselves, published a campaign
paper, styled the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Barnburner</span>, during the
canvass. The result at the polls was
signal only for its insignificance; and the
authors of the movement hardly had
credit for a respectable escapade. But
the event has proved that neither ridicule
nor raillery, nor, in later years, persecutions
and the intolerable pressure of
federal power, could turn back the revolution
thus feebly begun. In that
campaign issue of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Barnburner</span> were
sown the seeds of what became, in later
nomenclature, the Free Democracy,
and, later still, the 'Republican' party
of Missouri. The German population
of St. Louis sympathized from the start
with the free principles enunciated.
Frank Blair, Jr., became from that year
their political leader; right honestly did
he earn the position; and right well,
even his political foes have always admitted,
did he maintain it.</p>

<p>Frank Blair was a disciple of Benton;
yet, as is often the case, the pupil soon
learned to go far ahead of his teacher.
In 1852, there was a union of the Free
Democrats and National Democrats of
Missouri, in support of Franklin Pierce.
But the entire abandonment of Pierce's
administration to the rule of the Southern
oligarchs sundered the incongruous
elements in Missouri forever. In 1856
Benton was found supporting James
Buchanan for President; but Blair declined
to follow his ancient leader in that
direction. He organized the free-soil
element in St. Louis to oppose the Buchanan
electoral ticket. An electoral
ticket in the State at large, for John C.
Fremont, was neither possible nor advisable.
In some districts no man would
dare be a candidate on that side; in
others, the full free-soil vote, from the
utter hopelessness of success, would not
be polled; and thus the cause would be
made to appear weaker than it deserved.
To meet the emergency, and yet bear
witness to principle, the free-soil vote
was cast for the Fillmore electoral ticket,
'under protest,' as it was called, the
name of 'John C. Fremont' being printed
in large letters at the head of every
free-soil ballot cast. By this means the
Buchanan electors were beaten fifteen
hundred votes in St. Louis City and
County, where, by a union as Benton
proposed, they would have had three
thousand majority. But the 'free-soilers'
failed to defeat Buchanan in the
State.</p>

<p>Nothing discouraged by this result,
Blair resumed the work of organizing
for the future. The Fillmore party
gave no thanks to the free-soilers for
their aid in the presidential election,
nor did the latter ask any. They had
simply taken the choice of evils; and
now, renouncing all alliances, Blair became
the champion and leader of a self-existing,
self-reliant State party, that
should accomplish emancipation in Missouri.
He again established a newspaper
to inculcate free principles in the
State. By untiring effort, he revived
and recruited his party. He gave it
platforms, planned its campaigns, contested
every election in St. Louis,
whether for municipal officers, for State
legislature, or for Congress; and always
fought his battles on the most advanced
ground assumed by the growing free-soil
party of the Union. The powerful
and rapidly-increasing German population
of St. Louis responded nobly to his
zeal and skillful leadership. Soon a victory
was gained; and St. Louis declared
for freedom, amid acclamations that reverberated
throughout the States that

extended from the Ohio to the lakes,
and from the Mississippi to the Atlantic.
But, having wrenched victory from a
people so intolerant as the pro-slavery
population of Missouri, it was not to be
expected that he would retain it easily.
He was set upon more fiercely than ever.
The loss of the city of St. Louis was considered
a disgrace to the State; and the
most desperate personal malignity was
added to the resentment of pro-slavery
wrath in the future election contests in
that city. The corrupting appliances
of federal power were at last invoked,
under Buchanan's administration; and
Blair was for the moment overwhelmed
by fraud, and thrown out of Congress.
But, with a resolution from which even
his friends would have dissuaded him,
and with a persistency and confidence
that were a marvel to friend and foe, he
contested his seat before Congress, and
won it. And this verdict was soon ratified
by his brave and faithful constituency
at the polls. Such was the Republican
party, such their leader in St. Louis,
when the black day of disunion came.
And in their hands lay the destiny of the
State.</p>

<p>As soon as the presidential election
was decided, and the choice of Abraham
Lincoln was known, the disunionists in
Missouri commenced their work. Thomas
C. Reynolds, the lieutenant-governor,
made a visit to Washington, and extended
it to Virginia, counseling with the
traitors, and agreeing upon the time and
manner of joining Missouri in the revolt.
The legislature of Missouri met in the
latter part of December, about two
weeks after the secession of South Carolina.
A bill was at once introduced,
calling a State convention, and passed.
The message of Claiborne F. Jackson,
the governor, had been strongly in favor
of secession from the Union. The Missouri
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Republican</span>, the leading newspaper
of the State, whose advocacy had elected
the traitor, declared, on the last day of
the year, that unless guaranties in defence
of slavery were immediately given
by the North, Missouri should secede
from the Union. And so the secession
feeling gathered boldness and volume.</p>

<p>Candidates for the State convention
came to be nominated in St. Louis, and
two parties were at once arrayed&mdash;the
unconditional Union party, and the
qualified Unionists, who wished new
compromises. Frank Blair was one of
the leaders of the former, and he was
joined by all the true men of the old parties.
But the secessionists&mdash;they might
as well be so called, for all their actions
tended to weaken and discredit the
Union&mdash;nominated an able ticket.
The latter party were soon conscious of
defeat, and began to hint mysteriously
at a power stronger than the ballot-box,
that would be invoked in defence of
'Southern rights.' To many, indeed to
most persons, this seemed an idle threat.
Not so to Frank Blair. He had imbibed
from Benton the invincible faith
of the latter in the settled purpose of the
'nullifiers' to subvert and destroy the
government. And in a private caucus
of the leaders of the Union party, on an
ever-memorable evening in the month
of January, he startled the company by
the proposition that the time had come
when the friends of the government
must arm in its defence. With a deference
to his judgment and sagacity
that had become habitual, the Unionists
yielded their consent, and soon the enrolment
of companies began; nightly
drills with arms took place in nearly all
the wards of the city; and by the time
of election day some thousands of citizen
soldiers, mostly Germans, could have
been gathered, with arms in their hands,
with the quickness of fire signals at
night, at any point in the city. The
secessionists had preceded this armed
movement of the Union men by the organization
of a body known as 'minute-men.' But the promptness and superior
skill that characterized Frank
Blair's movement subverted the secession
scheme; and it was first repudiated,
and then its existence denied. The day
of election came, and passed peacefully.
The unconditional Union ticket was

elected by a sweeping majority of five
thousand votes. The result throughout
the State was not less decisive and surprising.
Of the entire number of delegates
composing the convention, not one
was chosen who had dared to express secession
sentiments before the people;
and the aggregate majority of the Union
candidates in the State amounted to
about eighty thousand. The shock of
this defeat for the moment paralyzed the
conspirators; but their evil inspirations
soon put them to work again. Their organs
in Missouri assumed an unfriendly
tone towards the convention, which was
to meet in Jefferson City. The legislature
that had called the convention remained
in session in the same place, but
made no fit preparations for the assembling
of the convention, or for the accommodation
and pay of the members.
The debate in the legislature on the bill
for appropriations for these purposes was
insulting to the convention, the more ill-tempered
and ill-bred secession members
intimating that such a body of 'submissionists'

were unworthy to represent
Missouri, and undeserving of any pay.
The manifest ill feeling between the two
bodies&mdash;the legislature elected eighteen
months previously, and without popular
reference to the question of secession,
and the convention chosen fresh from
the people, to decide on the course of
the State&mdash;soon indicated the infelicity
of the two remaining in session at the
same time and in the same place. Accordingly,
within a few days after the
organization of the convention, it adjourned
its session to the city of St. Louis.
It did not meet a cordial reception there.
So insolent had the secession spirit already
grown, that on the day of the assembling
of the convention in that city,
the members were insulted by taunts in
the streets and by the ostentatious floating
of the rebel flag from the Democratic
head-quarters, hard by the building in
which they assembled.</p>

<p>Being left in the undisputed occupancy
of the seat of government, the governor,
lieutenant-governor, and legislature
gave themselves up to the enactment of
flagrant and undisguised measures of
hostility to the federal government.
Commissioners from States that had renounced
the Constitution, and withdrawn,
as they claimed, from the Union,
arrived at Jefferson City as apostles of
treason. They were received as distinguished
and honorable ambassadors. A
joint session of the legislature was called
to hear their communications. The lieutenant-governor,
Reynolds, being the
presiding officer of the joint session, required
that the members should rise when
these traitors entered, and receive them
standing and uncovered. The commissioners
were allowed to harangue the representatives
of Missouri, by the hour, in
unmeasured abuse of the federal government,
in open rejoicings over its supposed
dissolution, and in urgent appeals
to the people of Missouri to join the
rebel States in their consummated treason.
Noisy demonstrations of applause
greeted these commissioners; and legislators,
and the governor himself, in a
public speech in front of the executive
mansion, pledged them that Missouri
would shortly be found ranged on the
side of seceded States. The treason of
the governor and legislature did not
stop with these manifestations. They
proceeded to acts of legislation, preparatory
to the employment of force, after
the manner of their 'Southern bretheren.'
First, it was necessary to get control
of the city of St. Louis. The Republican
party held the government of
the city, mayor, council, and police
force&mdash;a formidable Union organization.
The legislature passed a bill repealing
that part of the city charter that,
gave to the mayor the appointment of
the police, and constituting a board of
police commissioners, to be appointed
by the governor, who should exercise
that power. He named men that suited
his purposes. The Union police were
discharged, and their places filled by
secessionists. Next, the State militia
was to be organized in the interests of
rebellion, and a law was passed to accomplish
that end. The State was set
off into divisions; military camps were

to be established in each; all able-bodied
men between the ages of eighteen
and fifty were liable to be called into
camp and drilled a given number of
days in the year; and, when summoned
to duty, instead of taking the usual
oath to support the Constitution of the
United States, they were required only
to be sworn 'to obey the orders of the
governor of the State of Missouri.'
These camps were styled camps of instruction.
One of them was established
at St. Louis, within the corporate limits
of the city, about two miles west of
the court-house, on a commanding eminence.</p>

<p>Thus the lines began to be drawn
closely around the Unionists of St.
Louis. The State convention had adjourned,
and its members had gone
home, having done but little to re-assure
the loyalists. They had, indeed,
passed an ordinance declaring that Missouri
would adhere to the Union; but
the majority of the members had betrayed
such hesitancy and indecision,
such a lack of stomach to grapple with
the rude issues of the rebellion, that
their action passed almost without moral
effect. Their ordinance was treated
with contempt by the secessionists, and
nearly lost sight of by the people; so
thoroughly were all classes lashed into
excitement by the storm of revolution
now blackening the whole Southern
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The friends of the Union could look
to but one quarter for aid, that was
Washington, where a new administration
had so recently been installed,
amid difficulties that seemed to have
paralyzed its power. The government
had been defied by the rebellion at
every point; its ships driven by hostile
guns from Southern ports; its treasures
seized; its arsenals occupied, and its
abundant arms and munitions appropriated.
Nowhere had the federal arm
resented insult and robbery with a blow.
This had not been the fault of the government
that was inaugurated on the
fourth of March. It was the fruit of the
official treason of the preceding administration,
that had completely disarmed
the government, and filled the new executive
councils with confusion, by the
numberless knaves it had placed in all
departments of the public service, whose
daily desertions of duty rendered the
prompt and honest execution of the
laws impossible. But the fact was indisputable;
and how could St. Louis
hope for protection that had nowhere
else been afforded? The national government
had an arsenal within the city
limits. It comprised a considerable area
of ground, was surrounded by a high
and heavy stone wall, and supplied with
valuable arms. But so far from this establishment
being a protection to the
loyal population, it seemed more likely,
judging by what had occurred in other
States, that it would serve as a temptation
to the secession mob that was evidently
gathering head for mischief, and that
the desire to take it would precipitate
the outbreak. The Unionists felt their
danger; the rebels saw their opportunity.
Already the latter were boasting that
they would in a short time occupy this
post, and not a few of the prominent
Union citizens of the town were warned
by secession leaders that they would soon
be set across the Mississippi river, exiles
from their homes forever. As an instance
of the audacity of the rebel element
at this time, and for weeks later,
the fact is mentioned that the United
States soldiers, who paced before the
gates of the arsenal as sentinels on duty,
had their beats defined for them by the
new secession police, and were forbidden
to invade the sacred precincts of the
city's highway. The arsenal was unquestionably
devoted to capture, and it
would have been a prize to the rebels
second in value to the Gosport navy-yard.
It contained at this time sixty-six
thousand stand of small arms, several
batteries of light artillery and heavy
ordnance, and at least one million dollars'
worth of ammunition. It was besides
supplied with extensive and valuable
machinery for repairing guns, rifling
barrels, mounting artillery, and preparing
shot and shell. The future, to the

Union men of St. Louis, looked gloomy
enough; persecution, and, if they resisted,
death, seemed imminent; and no
voice from abroad reached them, giving
them good cheer. But deliverance was
nigh at hand.</p>

<p>About the middle of January, Capt.
Nathaniel Lyon, of the Second Infantry,
U.S.A., arrived in St. Louis with his
company; and his rank gave him command
of all the troops then at the arsenal
and Jefferson Barracks, a post on
the river, ten miles below, the department
being under the command of Brigadier
General Harney. Capt. Lyon
had been garrisoning a fort in Kansas.
He was known to some of the Union
men of St. Louis; and his resolute spirit
and devoted patriotism marked him as
their leader in this crisis. Frank Blair
at once put himself in communication
with Capt. Lyon, and advised him fully
and minutely as to the political situation.
He exposed to him the existence
of his volunteer military organization.
At his request Capt. Lyon visited and
reviewed the regiments; and it was arranged
between them that if an outbreak
should occur, or any attempt be
made to seize the arsenal, Capt. Lyon
should receive this volunteer force to his
assistance, arm it from the arsenal, and
take command for the emergency. It
should be known, however, to the greater
credit of the Union leaders of St.
Louis, that they had already, from private
funds, procured about one thousand
stand of arms, with which their nightly
drills, as heretofore stated, had been
conducted. As soon as Capt. Lyon's
connection with this organization was
suspected, an attempt was made to have
him removed, by ordering him to Kansas
on the pretext of a court of inquiry; but
this attempt was defeated. Thus matters
stood for a time, the Union men beginning
to be reassured, but still doubtful
of the end. After a while, Fort Sumter
was opened upon, and fell under its furious
bombardment. The torch of war was
lit. President Lincoln issued his proclamation
for volunteers. Gov. Jackson
telegraphed back an insolent and defiant
refusal, in which he denounced the
'war waged by the federal government'
as 'inhuman and diabolical.' Frank
Blair instantly followed this traitorous
governor's dispatch by another, addressed
to the Secretary of War, asking
him to accept and muster into service
the volunteer regiments he had
been forming. This offer was accepted,
and the men presented themselves. But
Brig. Gen. Harney, fearing that the
arming of these troops would exasperate
the secession populace, and bring about
a collision with the State militia, refused
to permit the men to be mustered into
service and armed. This extraordinary
decision was immediately telegraphed to
the government, and Gen. Harney was
relieved, leaving Capt. Lyon in full command.
This was the 23d of April. In
a week four full regiments were mustered
in, and occupied the arsenal. A
memorial was prepared and sent to
Washington by Frank Blair, now colonel
of the first of these regiments, asking
for the enrolment of five other regiments
of Home Guards. Permission was
given, and in another week these regiments
also were organized and armed.
The conflict was now at hand. Simultaneously
with this arming on the part
of the government for the protection of
the arsenal, the order went forth for
the assembling of the State troops in
their camps of instruction. On Monday,
the 6th of May, the First Brigade
of Missouri militia, under Gen. D.M.
Frost, was ordered by Gov. Jackson into
camp at St. Louis, avowedly for purposes
of drill and exercise. At the same
time encampments were formed, by order
of the governor, in other parts of
the State. The governor's adherents in
St. Louis intimated that the time for
taking the arsenal had arrived, and the
indiscreet young men who made up the
First Brigade openly declared that they
only awaited an order from Gov. Jackson&mdash;an
order which they evidently had
been led to expect&mdash;to attack the arsenal
and possess it, in spite of the feeble
opposition they calculated to meet from

'the Dutch' Home Guards enlisted to

defend it. A few days previously, an
agent of the governor had purchased at
St. Louis several hundred kegs of gun-powder,
and succeeded, by an adroit
stratagem, in shipping it to Jefferson
City. The encampment at St. Louis,
'Camp Jackson,' so called from the
governor, was laid off by streets, to
which were assigned the names 'Rue de
Beauregard,' and others similarly significant;
and when among the visitors whom
curiosity soon began to bring to the camp
a 'Black Republican' was discovered by
the soldiers,&mdash;and this epithet was applied
to all unconditional Unionists,&mdash;he
was treated with unmistakable coldness,
if not positive insult. If additional
proof of the hostile designs entertained
against the federal authority by
this camp were needed, it was furnished
on Thursday, the 9th, by the reception
within the camp of several pieces of cannon,
and several hundred stand of small
arms, taken from the federal arsenal at
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was then
in the possession of the rebels. These
arms were brought to St. Louis by the
steamboat <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">J.C. Swon</span>, the military authorities
at Cairo having been deceived
by the packages, which were represented
to contain marble slabs. On the arrival
of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Swon</span> at the St. Louis levee, the
arms were taken from her, sent to Camp
Jackson, and received there with demonstrations
of triumph.</p>

<p>When Capt. Lyon was entrusted with
full command at St. Louis, President
Lincoln had named, in his orders to him,
a commission of six loyal and discreet
citizens with whom he should consult in
matters pertaining to the public safety,
and with whose counsel he might declare
martial law. These citizens were
John How, Samuel T. Glover, O.D.
Filley, Jean J. Witsig, James O. Broadhead,
and Col. Frank P. Blair. The last
mentioned&mdash;Colonel Blair&mdash;was Capt.
Lyon's confidential and constant companion.
They were comrades in arms,
and a unit in counsel. Their views
were in full accord as to the necessity
of immediately reducing Camp Jackson.
Defiance was daily passing between the
marshalling hosts, not face to face, but
through dubious partisans who passed
from camp to camp, flitting like the
bats of fable in the confines of conflict.
Capt. Lyon's decision, urged thereto by
Col. Blair, was made without calling a
council of the rest of his advisers. They
heard of it, however, and, though brave
and loyal men all, they gathered around
him in his quarters at the arsenal,
Thursday evening, and besought him
earnestly to change his purpose. The
conference was protracted the livelong
night, and did not close till six o'clock,
Friday morning, the 10th. They found
Capt. Lyon inexorable,&mdash;the fate of
Camp Jackson was decreed. Col. Blair's
regiment was at Jefferson Barracks, ten
miles below the arsenal, at that hour.
It was ordered up; and about noon on
that memorable Friday, Capt. Lyon
quietly left the arsenal gate at the head
of six thousand troops, of whom four
hundred and fifty were regulars, the remainder
United States Reserve Corps
or Home Guards, marched in two columns
to Camp Jackson, and before the
State troops could recover from the
amazement into which the appearance
of the advancing army threw them, surrounded
the camp, planting his batteries
upon the elevations around, at a distance
of five hundred yards, and stationing
his infantry in the roads leading
from the grove wherein their tents were
pitched. The State troops were taken
completely by surprise; for, although
there had been vague reports current in
camp of an intended attack from the
arsenal, the cry of the visitors at the
grove, 'They're coming!' 'They're
coming!' raised just as the first column
appeared in sight, found them strolling
leisurely under the trees, chatting with
their friends from the city, or stretched
upon the thick green grass, smoking and
reading.</p>

<h2>Beaufort District,&mdash;Past, Present, And Future.</h2>


<p>The sovereign State of South Carolina
seems from the beginning to have
been actuated by the desire not only to
mold its institutions according to a system
differing entirely from that of its
sister States, but even to divide its territory
in a peculiar manner, for which
reason we find in it 'districts' taking
the place of counties. The south-west
of these bears the name of its principal
town, 'Beaufort.' It is bounded on the
west by the Savannah River, and on the
south by the Atlantic. Its length from
north to south is fifty-eight miles, its
breadth thirty-three miles, and it contains
about one and a quarter millions
of acres of land and water. Considered
geologically, Beaufort is one of the
most remarkable sections of the United
States. As recent events have brought
it so prominently before us, we propose
to consider its history, capacities, and
prospects.</p>

<p>From its proximity to the Spanish settlements
in the peninsula of Florida, its
beautiful harbors and sounds were early
explored and taken possession of by the
Spaniards. It is now certain they had
established a post here called 'Fort St.
Phillip,' at St. Elena,<a href="#note_2"><span class="footnoteref">2</span></a> as early as
1566-7; this was probably situated on
the south-western point of St. Helena
Island, and some remains of its entrenchment
can still be traced. From this fort
Juan Pardo, its founder, proceeded on
an expedition to the north-west, and explored
a considerable part of the present
States of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

<p>How long the Spaniards remained
here is now uncertain, but they long
claimed all this coast as far north as
Cape Fear. The French planted a colony
in South Carolina, and gave the
name Port Royal to the harbor and
what is now called Broad River; but
they were driven off by the Spaniards,
and history is silent as to any incidents
of their rule for a century. In 1670 a
few emigrants arrived in a ship commanded
by Capt. Hilton, and landed at
what is now known as 'Hilton's Head,'
the south-western point of Port Royal
harbor, which still perpetuates his name.
The colony was under the management
of Col. Sayle; but the Spaniards at St.
Augustine still claimed the domains, and
the settlers, fearing an attack, soon removed
to the site of Old Charleston, on
Ashley River. In 1682, Lord Cardoss
led a small band from Scotland hither,
which settled on Port Royal Island,
near the present site of Beaufort. He
claimed co-ordinate authority with the
governor and council at Charleston.
During the discussion of this point the
Spaniards sent an armed force and dislodged
the English, most of whom returned
to their native country. A permanent
settlement was finally made on
Port Royal Island in 1700. The town
of Beaufort was laid out in 1717, and an
Episcopal church erected in 1720. The
name was given from a town in Anjou,
France, the birthplace of several of the
Huguenot settlers.</p>

<p>For many years the Spaniards threatened
the coast as far north as Charleston,
but the settlement increased, and
extended over St. Helena and other islands.
Slavery was here coeval with
settlement, and the peculiar institution
was so earnestly fostered, that in 1724
it was estimated that South Carolina
contained 18,000 slaves to only 14,000
whites. The slaves were mostly natives
of Africa of recent importation, and
were poorly adapted to clear up the
forests and prepare the way for extensive
plantations, but their cost was small,
and every year they improved in capacity
and value. In the succeeding half
century were laid the fortunes of the
prominent families who have controlled
the district, and often greater interests,

to our day. Grants of land could be
had almost for the asking, especially by
men of influence; and fertile islands
were given, containing hundreds and
sometimes thousands of acres, to a single
family, who have here been monarchs
of all they survey, including hundreds
of slaves, till <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">the Hegira</span> or <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">flight</span>
A.D. 1861.</p>

<p>When we take into account the salubrity
of the climate and the fertility of
the soil, we must allow that this district
has many natural advantages which can
not be excelled by any section of the
same extent in this country. A considerable
part of the district is composed
of islands, which are supposed to be of
a comparatively recent formation, many
of them beautiful to the eye, and rich in
agricultural facilities; they are in number
upwards of fifty, not less than thirty
of them being of large size. Upon the
sea-coast are Reynolds, Prentice, Chaplins,
Eddings, Hilton Head, Dawfuskie,
Turtle, and the Hunting Islands. Behind
these lie St. Helena, Pinckney,
Paris, Port Royal, Ladies', Cane, Bermuda,
Discane, Bells, Daltha, Coosa,
Morgan, Chissolm, Williams Harbor,
Kings, Cahoussue, Fording, Barnwell,
Whale, Delos, Hall, Lemon, Barrataria,
Lopes, Hoy, Savage, Long, Round, and
Jones Islands. These are from one to
ten miles in length, and usually a proportional
half in width. St. Helena is
over twenty miles in extent, and could
well support an agricultural population
of twenty thousand. Port Royal is next
in size, but, being of a more sandy formation,
is not so fertile. These islands are
all of an alluvial formation,&mdash;the result
of the action of the rivers and the sea.
There is no rock of any kind, not even
a pebble stone, to be found in the whole
district.</p>

<p>The soil of these islands is composed
mostly of a fine sandy loam, very easily
cultivated. In most of them are swamps
and marshes, which serve to furnish muck
and other vegetable deposits for fertilizing;
but the idea of furnishing anything
to aid the long over-worked soil seems
to these proprietors like returning to the
slave some of the earnings taken from
him or his ancestors, and is seldom done
till nature is at last exhausted, and then
it is allowed only a few years' repose.
Situated under the parallel of 32, there
is scarcely a product grown in our country,
of any value, that can not be produced
here. Previous to the Revolution
the principal staple for market was
indigo, and that raised in this district always
commanded the highest price. It
was from the proceeds of this plant that
the planters were enabled for a long
period to purchase slaves and European
and northern American productions.
Soon after the Revolution their attention
was turned to cotton; but the difficulty
of separating it from the seed
seemed to make it impossible to furnish
it in any profitable quantity, for so slow
was the process then followed that, with
the utmost diligence, a negro could not,
by hand labor, clean over a few pounds
per day. The genius of Whitney, however,
opened a new era to the cotton
planters, who were much more eager to
avail themselves of his invention than to
remunerate him. It was soon perceived
that the cotton raised on these islands
was far superior to that produced in the
interior, which is still called Upland,
only to distinguish it from the 'Sea Island.'

It was also noticed that while
the common variety produced a seed
nearly green with a rough skin, the seed
of the islands soon became black with a
smooth skin; the effect entirely of location
and climate, as it soon resumes its
original color when transported back to
the interior. The cultivation of this variety
is limited to a tract of country of
about one hundred and fifty miles in
length, and not over twenty-five miles
in breadth, mostly on lands adjacent to
the salt water, the finest 'grades' being
confined to the islands within this district.
It is true that black-seed cotton
is cultivated to some extent along the
coast from Georgetown, S.C., to St. Augustine,
but a great part of it is of an inferior
quality and staple, and brings in
the market less than one-half the price
of the real 'Sea Island.' This plant

seems to delight in the soft and elastic
atmosphere from the Gulf Stream, and,
after it is 'well up,' requires but a few
showers through the long summer to
perfect it. It is of feeble growth, particularly
on the worn-out lands, and two
hundred pounds is a good yield from an
acre. An active hand can tend four
acres, besides an acre of corn and
'ground provisions;' but with a moderate
addition of fertilizers and rotation
of crops no doubt these productions
would be doubled. If the yield seems
small, the price, however, makes it one
of the most profitable products known.
The usual quotations for choice Sea Islands
in Charleston market has been for
many years about four times as great as
for the middling qualities of Uplands,&mdash;probably
an average of from thirty-five
to forty-five cents per pound; and for
particular brands<a href="#note_3"><span class="footnoteref">3</span></a> sixty to seventy
cents is often paid. The writer has
seen a few bales, of a most beautiful
color and length of staple, which sold
for eighty cents, when middling Uplands
brought but ten cents per pound. It is
mostly shipped to France, where it is
used for manufacturing the finest laces,
and contributes largely to the texture
of fancy silks, particularly the cheaper
kinds for the American market. After
passing above the flow of the salt water,
but within the rise of the tide, there is a
wide alluvial range along the rivers and
creeks, which, by a system of embankments,
can be flowed or drained at pleasure.
This is cultivated with rice, and,
if properly cared for, yields enormous
crops, sometimes of sixty bushels to an
acre. The land is composed of a mass
of muck, often ten feet deep and inexhaustible,
and never suffers from drought.
This land is very valuable, one hundred
dollars often being paid per acre for
large plantations. Much rice land, however,
remains uncleared for want of the
enterprise and perseverance necessary
to its improvement.</p>

<p>Farther in the interior the land is
principally of a sandy formation, most
of it underlaid with clay. Very little
effort is, however, made by planters to
cultivate it, although it is very easily
worked, and with a little manuring
yields fair crops of corn and sweet potatoes.
The cereal grains are seldom cultivated,
but no doubt they would yield
well. A large portion of the main-land
is composed of swamps, of which only
enough have been reclaimed to make it
certain that here is a mine of wealth to
those gifted with the energy to improve
it. The soil is as fertile as the banks of
the Nile, and nowhere could agricultural
enterprise meet with such certainly profitable
returns. Recurring again to the
agricultural capacity of the islands, it is
certain that good crops of sugar-cane
can be grown on them. During the war
of 1812, the planters turned their attention
to it, and succeeded well, since
which time many of them have continued
to plant enough for their own
use; but this plant soon exhausts such a
soil, unless some fertilizer is used, and
they therefore prefer cotton, which
draws a large part of its sustenance
from the atmosphere alone. The sweet
and wild orange grows here, and some
extensive groves are to be seen. Figs
are produced in abundance from September
till Christmas. Gardens furnish
abundant vegetables, yielding green peas
in March and Irish potatoes in May,
while numerous tribes of beautiful flowers
hold high carnival for more than
half the year.</p>

<p>This seems to be the true home of
the rose, which is found blooming from
March until Christmas. Many of the
rare climbing varieties of this flower,
which we see at the North only as small
specimens in green-houses, grow here
in wild profusion. The grape is represented
by many species indigenous to
this State alone, and could, no doubt, be
cultivated and produced in greater variety
and perfection than elsewhere on
this continent, as the climate is more
equable. A species of Indian corn,
called 'white flint corn,' and which

when cooked is very nutritious and
white as snow, seems indigenous to
these islands. It is much superior to
the common varieties.</p>

<p>Of the sylva we will only say, it is
equal in value and variety to that of
any section of our country. Here is the
home of the palmetto<a href="#note_4"><span class="footnoteref">4</span></a> or cabbage tree,
the only palm in our wide country. The
live oak, once so abundant, has, however,
been largely cut off, mostly to supply
our navy-yards, and some of the ships
built from it are now blockading the
very harbors from which it was carried.
The pitch pine is the common growth
of the interior, and under a new system
would form a valuable article of commerce
as lumber, and as yielding the
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">now</span> so much required turpentine. Of
wild animals and birds, here are to be
found a large variety. The Hunting Islands
and others are well stocked with
deer. During the winter wild, geese
and ducks abound, and a variety of fish,
with fine oysters, can be had at all seasons.</p>

<p>We now come to consider the present
inhabitants of this district. The whites
are almost entirely the descendants of
the earliest settlers of this State, who
were English,<a href="#note_5"><span class="footnoteref">5</span></a> Scotch, and Protestant
Irish, with a slight infusion of the Huguenot
and Swiss elements. A century
and a half has rendered them homogeneous.
As there has never been any
interest here other than agriculture, and
as every man may be said to own the
plantation he cultivates, there has been
as little change of property or condition
as possible, and therefore the same land
and system of cultivation has passed from
father to son through four or five generations.
Had there been any emigration
or change of population, some alterations,
and most likely new enterprise
and vigor, would have been infused, and
more modern and national feeling have
been instituted for their narrow and sectional
prejudices. No doubt our national
character has been much influenced
by the division of land. Where this has
been nearly equal, as in our New England
towns, a republican form of government
has been almost a necessity. But
at the South an entirely different arrangement
has prevailed. Land was at
first distributed in large bodies fitted to
accommodate a state of slavery; and
the consequence was that a feudal system
was inaugurated from the settlement,
which has continued with increasing
power. This has been one of the
permanent causes of Southern pride
and exclusiveness.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of South Carolina
and Virginia previous to the Revolution
were very supercilious towards the North,
and even to their less opulent neighbors
of Georgia and North Carolina; a feeling
which was often the cause of much antagonism
among the officers and soldiers
during the war. Charleston and Williamsburg
gave the tone to good society,
and it was haughty and aristocratic in
the extreme. While Virginia has for
the last half century been in a state of
comparative decay, South Carolina has,
by its culture of cotton and rice, just
been able to hold its own; but the pride
and exclusiveness of its people have increased
much faster than its material
interests. Although the Constitution of
the United States guarantees to every
State a republican form of government,
no thinking person who has resided for
a single week within the limits of
South Carolina can have failed to see

and feel that a tyranny equal to that of
Austria exists there. The freedom of
opinion and its expression were not permitted.
Strangers were always under
espionage, and public opinion, controlled
by an oligarchy of slave-holders,
overruled laws and private rights. Nowhere,
even in South Carolina, was this
feeling of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">hauteur</span> so strong as in that
portion of the State which we are describing.
On the large plantations the
owners ruled with power unlimited over
life and property, and could a faithful
record be found it would prove one of
vindictive oppression, productive oftentimes
of misery and bloodshed. Most
of the wealthier planters in the district
have residences at Beaufort, to which
they remove during the summer months
to escape the malaria arising from the
soil around their inland houses. This
place may be considered the home of
the aristocracy. Here reside the Barnwells,<a href="#note_6"><span class="footnoteref">6</span></a>
Heywards, Rhetts<a href="#note_7"><span class="footnoteref">7</span></a>(formerly
called Smiths,) Stuarts, Means, Sams,
Fullers,<a href="#note_8"><span class="footnoteref">8</span></a> Elliots,<a href="#note_9"><span class="footnoteref">9</span></a> Draytons and others,
altogether numbering about fifty families,
but bearing not more than twenty
different names, who rule and control
the country for forty miles around. This
is the most complete and exclusive approach
to 'nobility' of blood and feeling
on our continent. Nowhere else is
family pride carried to such an extent.
They look with supercilious disdain on
every useful employment, save only the
planting of cotton and rice. Nothing in
any of our large cities can equal the display
of equipages, with their profusion
of servants in livery, exhibited on pleasant
afternoons, when the mothers and
daughters of these cotton lords take
their accustomed airing. So powerfully
has this feeling of exclusiveness prevailed
that no son or daughter dares
marry out of their circle. For a long
series of years has this custom prevailed,
and the consequence is that the families
above named are nearly of a common
blood; and it needs no physiologist to
tell us the invariable effect arising from
this transgression of natural laws, on the
physical and mental faculties of both
sexes. In such a state of society is it
strange that the present generation
should have grown up with ideas better
suited to the castes of India than to
those of republican America? As a consequence
they consider their condition
more elevated than that of their neighbors
in the adjoining States, and of almost
imperial consideration. But no

language can express their bitter contempt
for the people of the North, more
particularly for those of New England
birth.</p>

<p>In perusing the history and progress
of any portion of our country, the statistics
of population become an interesting
study. Let us glance over a brief table,
showing what the increase has been in
this district for the past forty years, and
its miserable deficiency in physical means
of strength and defense. In 1820 the
district contained 32,000 souls, of which
there were 4,679 whites and 27,339
slaves, and 141 free blacks. In 1860
there were 6,714 whites and 32,500
slaves, and 800 free blacks, making a
total of 40,014,&mdash;an increase of whites
of 2,035, of slaves 5,161, of free blacks
650:&mdash;total increase 7,855 in forty
years. Here we have nearly the largest
disproportion of whites to slaves
in any part of the South. Of the
6,714 whites, about 1,000 are probably
men over twenty-one years of age,
and it is not to be presumed that an
equal number are capable of bearing
arms. Is it possible to find anywhere
a community more helpless for its own
protection or defense? It is one of the
truths of science and philosophy that
nature, when forced beyond its own
powers and laws, will react, and again
restore its own supremacy. So we here
find a magnificent space of country,
rich in all natural requisites, and unsurpassed
in its capabilities of producing
not only the necessaries of life, but
its luxuries, having an exclusive right
to some of the most valuable staples
of the world, which has been for a
century and a half the abode of an imperious
few, who have, by tyrannical
power, wrung from the bones and muscles
of generations of poor Africans the
means to sustain their luxury, power,
and pride. They have also robbed from
the mother earth the fertility of its soil
to its utmost extent, leaving much of it
completely exhausted. This state of
things has reacted on them; it has made
them proud, domineering, ambitious, and
revengeful of fancied injuries. It has
hurried them into rebellion against the
best government the world ever saw,&mdash;and
this has at last brought with it its
own punishment and retribution. It has
placed their soil, their mansions, their
crops and poor slaves in the possession
of the hated men of the North, and under
the laws and control of the government
they affected to despise. When
the last gun had sounded from the ramparts
at Port Royal, and the Stars and
Stripes again resumed their supremacy
on the soil of South Carolina, a new era
dawned over these beautiful islands and
waters, and the day that witnessed the
retreat of the rebel forces should hereafter
mark, like the flight of Mahomet,
the inauguration of a new dispensation
for this land and its people. Let us,
therefore, in continuing our chronicles,
cast the horoscope, and, without claiming
any spirit of prophecy, show the duties
of our nation in this contingency,
and the beneficial results that must flow
from it, if carried out with the energy,
perseverance, and practical Christianity
due to our country and the age in which
we live.</p>

<p>The accession to any government of
new territory brings with it new duties,
which it is always important should be
performed with energy and decision, so
that the greatest good, to the greatest
number, may be the result. A good
Providence has placed the domain under
consideration in our possession. Its
political condition is to us unique, and
almost embarrassing. If the question is
asked, 'Can we hold and dispose of a
part, or whole, of a sovereign State as a
conquered province?' the answer must
be in the affirmative. Government is
supreme, and must be exercised, particularly
to protect the weak, and for the
general good of the whole nation. Here
is a region, as fair as the sun shines upon,
now in a great measure deserted and
lying waste. What is to be done with
it? and what is our duty in this exigency?
The first want is a government,
for without a proper one no progress can
be made. Let Congress then at once establish
a territorial government over so

much of the State as we now have in
our possession, and over what we may
in future obtain;&mdash;not a government to
exhibit pomp, and show, but one practical
and useful, with a court and its
proper officers. Let every large unrepresented
estate be placed in the hands
of a temporary administrator, who should
be a practical and honest man, and
held to a strict account for all properties
entrusted to his keeping, and who should
act also as guardian to the slaves belonging
to the estate. Then enforce the collection
of a tax; and if the owner comes
forward within sixty days, pays the tax,
takes the oath of allegiance, and agrees
to remain in the territory and assist in
enforcing and executing the laws, during
that and the succeeding year, let
him resume his property, and be protected
in all his rights. But in default
of any loyal response from the proprietor,
the property should be disposed of,
in moderate quantities, to actual settlers,
who should be bound to do duty for its
defense, whenever called upon.</p>

<p>But then comes the great difficulty,
the disposition of the slaves,&mdash;the great
question which has so long been discussed
as a theory, and which now has
to be met as a practical measure. Let
us meet it as men and patriots, and, rising
above the clamor of fanatics, or the
proclamations of new-fangled and demagoguing
brigadiers, look at the permanent
result to our whole country, and
the real good of the African race.</p>

<p>Humanity, society, and property, all
have claims and acknowledged rights;
let them all be considered. It is well
known that the slaves on these islands
have always been kept in a state of
greater ignorance of the world and all
practical matters than those inhabiting
the border States, or where there is a
larger proportion of whites, with whom
they often labor and associate. To
emancipate them at once would be to
do a great wrong to the white man, to
the property, in whatever hands it might
be, and a still greater injury to the
slave. There can be but one way of disposing
of this question which will satisfy
the nation, and quiet the fears of the
conservative, and preserve the hopes of
the radical, which is, to pursue a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">middle</span>
course&mdash;a policy which shall as nearly
as possible equalize the question to all
parties. Let the slave be retained on
the plantation where he is found; and,
as no race are so much attached to their
own locality, so let them remain, place
them under a proper system of APPRENTICESHIP,
with a mild code of
laws, where every right shall be protected,
where suitable instruction, civil
and religious, shall be given, and where
the marriage rite shall be administered
and respected. Under such laws and
beneficent institutions, this territory
would soon be settled by men from the
West, the North, and from Europe, intelligent,
enterprising, and industrious,
who would retrieve its worn-out fields,
and introduce new systems of culture,
with all the modern labor-saving utensils.
With kind treatment and new
hopes, the simple sons of Africa would
have inducements to labor and to await
with patient hope the future and its rewards.
Then would Beaufort District
become what the Giver of all good designed
it to be&mdash;the abode of an industrious,
peaceful, and prosperous community.
The production of its great
staple, 'Sea-Island cotton,' would be immensely
increased, and its quality improved,
till it rivaled the silks of the
Old World. The yield of rice would be
doubled, and its gardens and orchards
would supply the North with fruits now
known only to the tropics.</p>

<p>So soon as the new government was
fairly inaugurated, and the condition of
the land and its future cultivation settled,
a movement would of necessity be
made to found here a city which would
be the great commercial metropolis of
the South.</p>

<p>Charleston was 'located' at the wrong
place, simply with the object of being as
distant as possible from the Spanish settlements,
and has always suffered from
an insufficient depth of water on its bars
to accommodate the largest class of merchant
ships. It has barely sixteen feet

of water at high tide, and ships loaded
as lightly as possible have often been
obliged to wait for weeks to enter or
leave the port. A decrease of one or
two feet in its main channel would, in
its palmiest days, have been fatal to its
prosperity. The sinking of a dozen
ships loaded with stone has no doubt
placed a permanent barrier to the entrance
of all but a small class of vessels.
The ships themselves may soon be displaced
or destroyed by the sea-worm, but
the New England granite will prove a
lasting monument to the folly and madness
of the rebellion. The destruction
of the best part of the city by fire seems
also to show that Providence has designed
it to be ranked only with the
cities of the past.</p>

<p>The productions of South Carolina
have always been large and valuable,
and since the completion of their system
of railroad facilities they have greatly
increased; therefore a commercial city
is a necessity, and Port Royal must be
its locality. Here is the noblest harbor
south of the Chesapeake, with a draught
of water of from twenty-five to thirty
feet, enough for the largest-sized ships,
and sufficient anchorage room for all the
navies of the world. Our government
should here have a naval depot to take
the place of Norfolk, since there is no
more suitable place on the whole coast.
In this connection the name, Royal Port,
is truly significant.</p>

<p>The precise locality for the new city
can not now be indicated, but we would
suggest the point some two miles south-west
of Beaufort, which would give it
a position not unlike New York. It
would have the straight Broad River for
its Hudson, with a fine channel on the
south and east communicating with numerous
sounds and rivers. Its situation
on an island of about the same length as
Manhattan completes the parallel.</p>

<p>The value of the produce conveyed
over the sounds and rivers connecting
with Port Royal, by sloops and steamers,
must be counted by millions of dollars.
We may estimate the crop of Sea-Island
cotton at about fifteen thousand
bales, or six millions of pounds, and of
rice about fifty million pounds. Yankee
enterprise would soon double the amount,
and add to it an immense bulk of naval
stores and lumber.</p>

<p>But this is but a moiety of what the
exports would be. A branch railroad
only ten miles long would connect this
port with all the railroads of South Carolina
and Georgia, which, diverging
from Charleston and Savannah, spread
themselves over a large part of five
States. This road would make tributary
to this place a vast district of country.</p>

<p>Savannah, which has for the last few
years competed with Charleston for this
trade, will soon feel the power of the
government, and it must yield up a
large part of its business to the more
favorable location of the new city.</p>

<p>A few short years, and what a change
may come over these beautiful islands
and the waters that hold them in its embrace!
A fair city, active with its commerce
and manufactures, wharves and
streets lined with stores and dwellings,
interspersed with churches and schools,
inhabited by people from every section
of our country, and from every part of
Europe, all interested to improve their
own condition, and all combining to add
strength and wealth to the Union which
they agree to respect, love, honor, and
defend!</p>

<h2>The Ante-Norse Discoverers Of America.</h2>
<p></p>

<div>
<a name="toc_5"></a>
<h3>I. The Mythical Era.</h3>

<p>Who were the first settlers in America?</p>

<p>Within a few years our school-books
pointed to Cristoval Colon, or Columbus,
and his crew, as the first within the range
of history who 'passed far o'er the ocean
blue' to this hemisphere. Now, however,
even the school-books&mdash;generally
the last to announce novel truths&mdash;say
something of the Norsemen in America,
though they frequently do it in a discrediting
and discreditable way. However,
the old Vikings have triumphed
once more, even in their graves, and Professor
Rafn can prove as conclusively
that his fierce ancestry trod the soil of
Boston as that the Mayflower Puritans
followed in their footsteps. It is a dim
old story, laid away in Icelandic manuscripts,
and confirmed by but few relics
on our soil; yet it is strong enough to
give New England a link to the Middle
Ages of Europe, with their wildest romance
and strangest elements. It is
pleasant to think that far back in the
night there walked for a short season on
these shores great men of that hearty
Norse-Teuton race which in after times
flowed through France into England, and
from England through the long course of
ages hitherward. Among the old Puritan
names of New England there is more
than one which may be found in the roll
of Battle Abbey, and through the Norse-Norman
spelling of which we trace the
family origin of fierce sea-kings in their
lowland isles or rocky lairs on the Baltic.</p>

<p>But there are older links existing between
America and Europe than this of
the Norseman. Of these the first is indeed
buried in mystery&mdash;leading us
back into that sombre twilight of 'symbolism,'
as the Germans somewhat obscurely
call the study of the early ages
whose records are lost, and which can
only be traced by reflection in the resemblances
between mythologies which
argue a common origin, and the monuments
remaining, which seem to establish
it. Yes, America has this in common
with every country of Asia, Europe,
and Africa: she has relics which indicate
that at one time she was inhabited
by a race which had perhaps the same
faith, the same stupendous nature-worship,
with that of the Old World, and
which was, to reason by analogy, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">possibly</span>

identified by the same language and
customs. What <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">was</span> this race, this religion,
this language? Who shall answer?
Men like Faber, and Higgins,
and Lajard, with scores of others, have
unweariedly gathered together all the
points of resemblance between the religions
and mythologies of the Hindus
and Egyptians and Chinese, the Druids
and the Phenicians, the Etruscans and
the Scandinavians, and old Sclavonic
heathen, and found in and between and
through them all a startling identity:
everywhere the Serpent, everywhere
the Queen of Heaven with her child,
everywhere the cup of life and the bread
and honey of the mysteries, with the salt
of the orgie, everywhere a thousand
fibres twining and trailing into each
other in bewildering confusion, indicating
a common origin, yet puzzling beyond
all hope those who seek to find it.
So vast is the wealth of material which
opens on the scholar who seeks to investigate
this common origin of mythologies,
and with them the possible early identity
of races and of languages, that he is
almost certain to soon bury himself in a
hypothesis and become lost in some blind
alley of the great labyrinth.</p>

<p>Certain points appear to have once
existed in common to nations on every
part of the earth previous to authentic
history, and in these America had probably
more or less her share, as appears
from certain monuments and relics of
her early races. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p>1. A worship of nature, based on the
inscrutable mystery of generation with
birth and death. As these two extremes
caused each other, they were continually
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">identified</span> in the religious myth or symbol
employed to represent either.</p>

<p>2. This great principle of action, developing
itself into birth and death, was
regarded as being symbolized in every
natural object, and corresponding with
these there were created myths, or 'stories,'

setting forth the principal mystery
of nature in a thousand poetic forms.</p>

<p>3. The formula according to which all
myths were shaped was that of transition,
or <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">the passing through</span>. The germ,
in the mother or in the plant, which
after its sleep reappeared in life, was also
recognized in Spring, or Adonis, coming
to light and warmth after the long death
of winter in the womb of the earth.
The ark, which floats on the waters,
bearing within it the regenerator, signified
the same; so did the cup or horn into
which the wine of life was poured and
from which it was drunk; so too did nuts,
or any object capable of representing latent
existence. The passing into a cavern
through a door between pillars or
rocky passes, or even the wearing of
rings, all intimated the same mystery&mdash;the
going into and the coming forth into
renewed life.</p>

<p>4. But the great active principle which
lay at the foundation of the mystery of
birth and death, or of action, was set
forth by the serpent&mdash;the type of good
and evil, of life and destruction&mdash;the
first intelligence. It is the constant recurrence
of this symbol among the early
monuments of America, as of the Old
World, which proves most conclusively
the existence at one time of a common
religion, or 'cultus.' It was probably
meant to signify water from its wavy
curves, and the snake-like course of rivers,
as inundation seems to have been,
according to early faith, the most prolific
source of the destruction of nature,
and yet the most active in its revival.</p>

<p>There are in Brittany vast lines of
massy Druidic stones, piled sometimes for
leagues in regular order, in such a manner
as to represent colossal serpents.
Those who will consult the French <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Dracontia</span>
will be astonished at the labor
expended on these strange temples.
Squier has shown that the earth-works
of the West represent precisely the
same symbol. Mexico and South America
abound, like Europe and the East,
in serpent emblems; they twine around
the gods; they are gods themselves;
they destroy as Typhon, and give life
in the hands of Esculapius.</p>

<p>In the United States, as in Europe
and in the East, there are found in steep
places, by difficult paths, always near
the banks of streams, narrow, much-worn
passages in rocks, through which
one person<a href="#note_10"><span class="footnoteref">10</span></a> can barely squeeze, and
which were evidently not intended for
ordinary travel. The passing through
these places was enjoined on religious
votaries, as indicating respect for the
great principle of regeneration. The
peasants of Europe, here and there,
at the present day, continue to pass
through these rock or cave doors, 'for
luck.' It was usual, after the transition,
whether into a cave, where mysteries,
feasts, and orgies were held, significant
of 'the revival,' or merely through a
narrow way,&mdash;to bathe in the invariably
neighboring river; the serpent-river or
water which drowns organic life, yet
without which it dies.</p>

<p>In England, at a comparatively recent
period, and even yet occasionally
in Scandinavia, the peasantry plighted
their troth by passing their hands
through the hole in the 'Odin-stones,'
and clasping them. Beads and wedding
rings and 'fairy-stones,' or those
found with holes in them, were all linked
to the same faith which rendered sacred
every resemblance to the 'passing
through.' The graves of both North and

South America contain abundant evidence
of the sacredness in which the
same objects were held. I have a singularly-shaped
soapstone ornament, taken
from an Indian grave, whose perforation
indicates the 'fairy-stone.' The
religious legends of Mexico and of Peru
are too identical with many of the Old
World to be passed over as coincidences;
the gold images of Chiriqui,
with their Baal bell-ringing figures, and
serpent-girt, pot-bellied phallic idols, are
too strikingly like those of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Old</span> Ireland
and of the East not to suggest some far-away
common origin. I have good authority
for saying that almost every
symbol, whether of cup or dove, serpent
or horn, flower or new moon, boat or
egg, common to Old World mythology,
may be found set forth or preserved
with the emphasis of religious emblems
in the graves or ruined temples of ancient
North America.</p>

<p>The mass of evidence which has been
accumulated by scholars illustrative of
a common origin of mythologies and a
centralization of them around the serpent;
or, as G.S. Faber will have it,
the Ark; or, as some think, the heavenly
bodies; or, as others claim, simply
a worship of paternity and maternity,&mdash;is
immense. Why they should claim
separate precedence for symbols, all of
which set forth the one great mystery
how GOD 'weaves and works in action's
storm,' is only explicable on the ground
that 'every scholar likes to have his own
private little pet hypothesis.' Enough,
however, may be found to show that this
stupendous nature-worship <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">was</span> held the
world over,&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">possibly</span> in the days of a
single language,&mdash;in America as in ancient
Italy, or around the sacred mountain-crags
of India; in Lebanon as in
Ireland, in the garden-lands of Assyria,
and in the isles of the South.</p>

<p>Yet all this is as yet, for the truly scientific
ethnologist, only half-fact, indefinite,
belonging to the cloud-land of
fable. The poet or the thinker, yearning
for a new basis of art, may find in
the immense mass of legends and symbols
an identification between all the
forms of nature in a vast harmony and
mutual reflection of every beautiful object;
but for the man of facts it is
unformed, not arranged, useless. We
know not the color of the race or races
which piled the Western mounds; their
languages are lost; they are vague mist-gods,
living in a dimmer medium than
that of mere tradition. So ends the
first period of intercommunication between
Asia&mdash;the probable birthplace of
the old mythology&mdash;and America.</p>
</div>

<div>
<a name="toc_6"></a>
<h3>II. The Chinese Discoverers Of Mexico In The Fifth Century.</h3>

<p>But there is a second link, ere we
come to the Norsemen, which is strong
enough to merit the favorable consideration
of the scientific man, for it rests on
evidence worthy serious investigation.
I refer to the fact that the Chinese-Annals,
or Year Books,&mdash;which, according
to good authority, have been well kept,
and which are certainly prosaic and
blue-bookish enough in their mass of dry
details of embassies and expenditures to
be highly credible,&mdash;testify that in the
fifth century the Chinese learned the situation
of the great peninsula Aliaska,
which they named Tahan, or Great
China. Beyond this, at the end of the
fifth century,&mdash;be it observed that the
advances in discovery correspond in
time in the records,&mdash;they discovered a
land which Deguignes long after identified
with the north-west coast of America.
With each discovery, the people
of these new lands were compelled, or
were represented at court as having
been compelled, to send ambassadors
wife tribute to the Central Realm, or
China.</p>

<p>But there had been unofficial Chinese
travelers in Western America, and
even in Mexico itself, before this time.
Those who have examined the history
of that vast religious movement of Asia
which, contemporary with Christianity,
shook the hoary faiths of the East, while
a higher and purer doctrine was overturning
those of the West, are aware
that it had many external points or
forms in common with those of the later

Roman church, which have long been a
puzzle to the wise. To say nothing
of mitres, tapers, violet robes, rosaries,
bells, convents, auricular confession, and
many other singular identities, the early
Buddhist church distinguished itself by
a truly catholic zeal for the making of
converts, and, to effect this, sent its emissaries
to Central Africa and Central
Russia; from the Sclavonian frontier on
the west to China, Japan, and the farthest
Russian isles of the east. On
they went; who shall say where they
paused? We know that there are at
this day in St. Petersburg certain books
on black paper taken from a Buddhist
temple found in a remote northern corner
of Russia. It was much less of an
undertaking, and much less singular,
that Chinese priests should pass, by short
voyages, from island to island, almost
over the proposed Russian route for the
Pacific telegraph to America. That
they <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">did so</span> is explicitly stated in the
Year Books, which contain details relative
to <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Fusang</span>, or Mexico, where it
is said of the inhabitants that 'in earlier
times these people lived not according
to the laws of Buddha. But it
happened in the second "year-naming"
"Great Light" of Song (A.D. 458), that
five beggar monks, from the kingdom
Kipin, went to this land, extended over
it the religion of Buddha, and with it his
holy writings and images. They instructed
the people in the principles of
monastic life, and so changed their manners.'</p>

<p>But I am anticipating my subject.
In another chapter I propose, on the
authority of Professor Neumann, a
learned Sinologist of Munich, to set
forth the proofs that in the last year of
the fifth century a Buddhist priest, bearing
the cloister name of Hoei-schin, or
Universal Compassion, returned from
America, and gave for the first time an
official account of the country which he
had visited, which account was recorded,
and now remains as a simple fact among
the annual registers of the government.</p>

<h2>The Fatal Marriage Of Bill The Soundser.</h2>


<p>Reader, possibly you do not know
what a 'Soundser' is. Then I will tell
you. In the coastwise part of the State
of New Jersey in which I live, numerous
sounds and creeks everywhere divide
and intersect the low, sea-skirting
lands, wherein certain people are wont
to cruise and delve for the sake of securing
their products, and hence come
to be known in our homely style as
Soundsers. The fruitage afforded by
these sounds is both manifold and of
price. Throughout all the pleasant
weather, they yield, with but little intermission,
that gastronomic gem, the
terrapin; the succulent, hard-shell clam,
and the 'soft' crab; the deep-lurking,
snowy-fleshed hake, or king-fish; the
huge, bell-voiced drum, and that sheen-banded
pride of American salt-water
fishes, the sheepshead. During the
waning weeks of May, and also with
the continuance of dog-days, this already
profuse bounty receives a goodly
accession in the shape of vast flocks of
willets, curlews, gray-backs, and other
marine birds, which, with every ebb
tide, resort to their shoaler bars and
flats, to take on those layers of fat
which the similarly well-conditioned old
gentleman of the city finds so inexpressibly
delicious. When the summer is
once, over, and while the cold weather
prevails, they furnish another and quite
new set of dainties. Then the span-long,
ripe, 'salt' oyster is to be had
for the raking of their more solidly-bottomed
basins; and all along their more
retired nooks and harbors, the gunner,
by taking proper precautions, may bring
to bag the somewhat 'sedgy' but still
well-flavored black duck, the tender
widgeon, the buttery little bufflehead,
the incomparable canvas-back, and the
loud-shrieking, sharp-eyed wild goose.
All this various booty is industriously
secured by the 'soundsers,' to find, ere
long, a ready market in the larger inland
towns and cities. But united to
this shooting, fishing, and oyster-catching,
they have another 'trade' whose
scene is on the waters, though it connects
itself with the sea, rather than
the sounds, and <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">this</span> is 'wrecking.'

They are prompt for this service whenever
the occasion requires; indeed, I
sometimes think they prefer it, dangerous
though it be, before all others. Inured
as they are to every sort of exposure,
they are of course a tough and
rugged race; and what with their diversity
of occupation, calling, as it does,
for a constant interchange of the use
of the gun, net, boat, fishing line, and
some one or other arm or edge tool,
they are usually, nay, almost invariably,
handy and quick-witted.</p>

<p>By far the most notable 'soundser'
our neighborhood ever bred was my
hero, BILL. Physically, at least, he
was a true wonder. He stood full six
feet two, weighed eleven score pounds,
and at the same time carried no more
flesh than sufficed to hide the exact
outline of his bones. Another man so
strong as he I have never seen. I have
repeatedly known him to lift and walk
off with anchors weighing five and six
hundred weight; and those big, thick
hands of his could twist any horseshoe
as if it were a girl's wreath. Certainly
he was not in the least graceful; that
'ponderosity' of his could in no way be
repressed. But he was still of rude
comeliness, his shape being squarely fitted
and tolerably proportioned, while his
broad, red-maned visage wore a constant
glow of plain, though sincere,
kindliness and good-humor.</p>

<p>As his physical man was uncommon,
so he had uncommon mental endowments.
He was the only 'soundser' I
ever knew who understood farming. He
had inherited a farmstead of some twenty-five
or thirty acres, and this he soon
had blooming as the rose. When occasion

required, he wrought on it, day and
night. He divided it, with truest judgment,
into proper fields, experimented
successfully with various kinds of novel
manures (most of which he obtained
from the sea), grew stock, planted, in
rotation, and, with only here and there
a sympathizer, gave in his full adherence
to the theory of root culture.
And he was a mechanic. He could
build house or barn to the last beam,
and ship or boat to the last joint; nay,
he once devised the model of a self-righting
life-boat, which I have often
heard shipmasters, and even real shipwrights,
descant upon in the highest
terms of praise. Moreover, I can affirm
that he was a navigator. It is
true that the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">science</span> of seamanship,
as set forth in books, he had never
mastered. But he knew right well
what winds of a certain force and direction
foretold, what waves of a certain
height and aspect meant; and this
knowledge, combined with a squint,
now and then, at his pocket compass,
sufficed to enable him to take a vessel
with safety anywhere along our coast.</p>

<p>But while my old pal showed high
abilities in other arts, as a 'soundser'
and wrecker he was not to be matched.
He brought to the first of these pursuits
a clearness of observation which
would have met the approbation of
many an acknowledged man of science.
He knew every sort of food which bird
and fish fed upon, where it was to be
found, and the circumstances favorable
to its production. He knew why the
game resorted to certain spots yesterday,
and avoided them to-day; what circumstances&mdash;and
they are very many&mdash;impelled
it to joyousness or quietude;
and what were most of its minor instincts.
And all this was done <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">thoroughly</span>,
withal. There was no haphazard
or uncertainty in any of his
conclusions. Taking thought of sundry
conditions, he could tell at any
time when such a thing was applicable;
how many sheepsheads one could
catch in the sounds; whether the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">honk</span>
of the wild goose, flying overhead, announced
that he was on his way to a
fresh-water pool or a bar of gravel;
whether the black ducks were cooling
their thirsty gizzards in a woodland
pond, sitting scattered about the marshes,
or huddling together on the bosom
of the sea. In a word, his mind had
gathered unto itself every law, of the
least importance, affecting the existence
of such wild creatures about us
as cost any pains to bring to hand;
and thus he was literally master over
them, and held their lives subject to
his will. That this power was really
surprising, will hardly be disputed; and
since we, his associates, could in no
way possess ourselves of the like, it
passed among us for something almost
miraculous.</p>

<p>Still, brilliant 'soundser' as old Bill
was, he was far greater as a wrecker;
since I am now about to relate an occurrence
in the line which proves him
a veritable hero. As is perfectly well
known, our American coast is often
the scene of fearful storms, which deal
out wide-spread destruction to mariners.
With us, these gales are commonest
in February, and hence this
month is held in marked dread. Some
years ago, in the season referred to, a
storm burst upon our shores, whose
like only a few of the older among us
had ever known. After fitfully moaning
from the northward and eastward
for a day or two, the wind, one morning,
finally settled due north-east,&mdash;thus
sweeping directly upon the land,&mdash;and
blew a hurricane. It was excessively
cold, too, yet not so cold but that a
fine, dry snow was falling, though from
the fury of the wind this could settle
nowhere, but was driven, whirling and
surging, before the blast in dense clouds.
In short, it was a time of truly unearthly
wildness; and our hearts sank the
deeper in us, since we knew what ere
long must inevitably occur. At last,
within an hour or two of nightfall, the
sound of a ship's bell, rung hurriedly,
pealed towards us along the uproar of
the tempest, and by this we were made
aware that a vessel had been wrecked

on a certain shoal rising up in the
ocean, about two miles from that part
of the beach nearest our village. To
go to the rescue of this vessel, at this
time, was absolutely impossible. For, to
say nothing of the wrath of the winds,
the air was so thick with snow that, in
the speedily advancing hours of darkness,
in which we should not fail to
be entrapped, we would be powerless
to find our way at sea a foot. There
was no help for it; the poor victims
of the shipwreck must that very night
know death in one or another most
terrifying shape, 'if it was the will
of the Lord.' With this mournful
conviction, about twenty of us gathered
at old Bill's house with the closing
in of a darkness as of Tartarus,
and kept its watches. The anger of
the storm abated in no way whatever
till morning, and then the sole change
that took place was a somewhat thinner
aspect of the driving snow. Yet,
even when this was discerned, every
man of us hastened to draw over his
ordinary winter garb an oil-cloth suit
which enveloped him from head to foot,
and soberly announced himself ready
to do his duty in the strait. That we
should be exposed to the greatest dangers
was absolutely certain; and whether
a single survivor of the terrors of
that awful night yet clung to the few
frail timbers in the sea, for us to rescue,
none but Heaven knew; still, the
manhood of each demanded that what
was possible to be done in the matter
we should at least attempt.</p>

<p>And so we started; the leader being
old Bill, who to some end, that I could
not then divine, bore a boat-sail bundled
on his back. Our first business
was to make way to our surf or life boat.
This lay about three miles from the village,
reckoning as the crow flies, and
was sheltered under a rude house which
stood on the shores of a bay opening by
an inlet into the sea. Our common
way of gaining this house was through
a circuitous passage of the sounds; but
these we soon discovered, in consonance
with a previous prediction of old Bill's,
were entirely frozen over save in certain
parts of their channels; and hence, this
route being unnavigable for such boats
as were at hand, which, without exception,
were light gunning and fishing
skiffs, we were forced to avail ourselves
of a barely practicable land track of
which we knew, and which, as it led
about among the marshes, was also circuitous.
And the necessity of choosing
this land path added to our difficulties,
in that we were forced to provide ourselves
with a small batteau and drag it
behind us, to be able to cross many
ditches and sloughs with which it was
barred, and which, particularly along
their edges, were never really frozen.
After toiling and battling for a long period,
and at the same time having to
face the most painfully cutting wind
that burst unobstructedly over the level
area of the marshes, we at last reached
the house wherein the life-boat lay, and
when old Bill had scrutinized its oars,
and stored it with a mingled collection
of cordage, canvas and spars, we ran
it into the water. But now another
trouble arose. The bay, like the sounds
of which indeed it formed a part, was
covered with ice,&mdash;either in solid sheets,
or that thick slush, peculiar to ocean estuaries,
which is chiefly known as 'porridge
ice,'&mdash;and, from its comparative
shallowness, covered so densely, too,
that if we had trusted to getting our
boat out of it by sheer rowing, it would
have taken us the entire day so to do.
In this emergency nothing would serve
but that we must advance bodily into
the water, and, crushing and clearing
away the ice with our feet, drag the
boat, in a depth at least sufficient for
her to float, to the entrance of the inlet,
where the current ran so strongly that
no ice could gather. After a severely
trying amount of labor, this point was
finally gained, and we stood fairly in
front of the tall, thundering breakers;
whereupon each man nimbly jumped to
his place in the craft, that of steersman
being the post of old Bill.</p>

<p>As we gave way on our oars, we shot
along the inlet without much difficulty;

and presently old Bill announced that,
he caught a faint sight of the wreck in
the distance&mdash;to all appearance 'most
all gone but the hull.' But we had little
or no opportunity to indulge in speculation
or remark on the discovery, for
in a moment or two we began to oppose
the wildness of the open main, and the
hour of our real trial set in. For the
first time we could now appreciate the
full force of the gale. Good Heavens,
how it blew! The waters seemed alive
and in direst convulsion. Everywhere
huge walls of breakers were constantly
upheaved to be felled and shattered
with a roar as of some terrific cannonade;
while the air became the arena for
a helter-skelter tossing of sheets of spray,
clots of froth, and spirts of brine, which
plentifully assailed our poor boat in their
madness, and, besides partially filling her
with slush, encased every man in a complete
coating of ice. If our craft had
not been modeled with the very highest
degree of skill, and if our steersman had
not been one of a thousand, we could
have made no headway at all in this
appalling tumult. As it was, our advance
was of the weakest, and its success
seemed very doubtful, let our efforts
be what they might. Not but
what we could sufficiently hold our own
in the swirl of the vanquished waves;
but when they swooped upon us in their
full stature, they not only sent the boat
back as if she had been a mere feather,
but with a second's awkwardness on the
part of old Bill they would have flung
her clean over from stem to stern, and
our places among the living would have
been vacant. Having strained every
nerve for nearly two hours, we were
still but part way through the breakers,
while some of the men began to complain
of fatigue; with which old Bill
seized a favorable opportunity to put
the boat about, and we were swept
ashore on the beach as in the twinkling
of an eye. Here, we secured our boat
by hauling her high and dry on the
strand; freed her from the slush and
water which had gained in her bottom;
and then retired to the leeward of a
range of sand hills near by, to recruit
our energies.</p>

<p>With full leisure to ponder over the
difficulties confronting our expedition,
some few of the crew now began to

'speak it foully,' and even to emit gruff
proposals to return homewards. But to
these waverers old Bill at once administered
the sternest rebuke; and, as they
at last held their peace, he averred with
a gay smile (for he dearly loved the
presence of danger, and could never be
brought to look on it other than as a
rough sort of irresponsible horse-play,
over which he was sure in one way or
another to gain the mastery), that he
had now weighed all the conditions of
the pass, and that the next time we attempted
it we should assuredly prevail.
This assertion, coming from such a source,
encouraged one and all very greatly;
and ere long we cheerfully launched
our boat once more, and again began to
tug at the quivering oars. In a very
little while it became apparent enough
that the tactics that Bill intended to
adopt in our present venture were very
different from those put in practice with
the last. Instead of boldly facing the
breakers as he had heretofore done, he
now began his maneuvering by laying
us directly in the trough of the sea,&mdash;planting
the boat a little crosswise, however,
so as to prevent an untoward swell
from riding over her side and thus filling
her,&mdash;and the instant he saw an advancing
breaker beginning to fracture,
as a prelude to its downfall and destruction,
he boldly sped us, when the thing
was at all practicable, straight in the
teeth of the gap, and as it proceeded to
widen, we shot through it, with the surf
leaping and tossing on either hand high
above our heads. This stroke could have
been possible only to a steersman possessed
of herculean strength, combined
with the rarest daring and coolness;
and, as the result of these qualities, it
was exceedingly effective. It lessened
the danger of our being capsized almost
entirely. Indeed, the sole mishap
that was threatened by so doing, was
the liability to being swamped by the

falling fragments of the breakers; but
this peril old Bill declared we might
safely trust he would also avert. It being
the nature of humanity to experience
a mood of high exaltation with the
surmounting of any serious obstacle, we
now worked our way with minds light
and cheery, and with all thoughts of anything
like fatigue completely forgotten.
Though our course was on the whole a
zigzag one, and though we certainly
met with one or two serious rebuffs, we
were constantly gaining headway, and
in something over an hour forced the
last line of the breakers, and stemmed
what on ordinary occasions would have
been simply the blue body of the Atlantic.
But even here a huge commotion
was reigning, though our progress was
far less tedious than it had previously
been; and with about another hour's labor
we were alongside the wreck, and
had climbed to her deck.</p>

<p>The plight of the vessel was mournful
enough. She had evidently been built
for a three-masted schooner, but, as Bill
had observed when he first obtained a
view of her, everything about her was
well-nigh gone save her hull. Her bulwarks
had been thoroughly crushed, and
so the sea had successively torn away
her boats, shivered her galley and wheelhouse,
and filled her cabin and hold.
Her masts were also destroyed, the fore
and mizzen masts being carried away
from their steppings, and the main-mast
broken completely in twain just above
the cross-trees. But a sight still more
desolate, as well as harrowing, yet awaited
us, as, in overhauling the sail-encumbered
shrouds of the partially standing
mast, we discovered several ice-bound
figures rigidly hanging therein, which,
being cut away and lowered to our boat,
proved to be the body of a negro perfectly
stark and dead, and three most
pitiable white sailors, whose life was so
far extinguished that they could neither
move hand nor foot, nor utter more than
the feeblest moans.</p>

<p>When we had covered the face of the
dead and sheltered the well-nigh dead as
best we could in the bottom of our boat,
of course our chief thought was to return
to the shore as swiftly as possible. But
on this head there was no call to entertain
the smallest solicitude; for after old
Bill, from a motive that we could not
yet name, had 'stepped' a mast through
one of the foremost thwarts of the boat,
and rigged a sail all ready to be spread,
we cast off from the wreck, and presently,
dropping into the full strength of the
wind, were swept onward like an arrow,
with scarce the least use of any other
oar than that in the hands of our stalwart
steersman. Speedily crossing the
outer waters, we leaped and bounded
over the breakers; and when old Bill, as
we were rushing along the inlet, gave
orders for the hoisting of the sail, we
not only hastened to obey him, but immediately
saw an all-important reason
for the command. For we were now
about entering the ice of the sounds;
and as the boat flew in its midst, her
stiff, tight sail drove her through the
stubborn obstruction as easily and in
much the same manner as the steam
plow rips up the matted bosom of the
prairies. In due season we reached the
landing where we usually disembarked
from the sounds, and where we found a
wagon awaiting us, to which we bore
our sad freightage, and led the way for
old Bill's house. On arriving, we laid
the corpse in an outbuilding and carried
the sailors into a bedroom. But what
was to be next done? To tell the
truth, most of us knew no more than so
many children. But here our leader
again showed his knowledge. Strongly
condemning the lighting of a fire in the
apartment,&mdash;which some one was about
to do,&mdash;he set us busily at work bringing
him a good supply of tubs, and
buckets of cold water, into which he
dipped the naked persons of the sufferers;
and as this treatment, combined
with a patient, gentle chafing, which
was also administered, at last restored
the flow of their vital forces, he gave
them a few spoonfuls of broth apiece,
and, while they looked a gratefulness
they could nowise express, lifted them
like babes with his giant arms to warm

beds, where they fell into what was at
first a fitful, broken slumber, but finally
a childlike, placid sleep. They were
saved!</p>

<p>If the reader is now curious to know
why a man like old Bill was not a patrician
and captain in the campaign of
life, rather than the mere private and
plebeian he was, I can answer that there
were several things which impeded that
consummation. His character, though
of wonderful height and force in some
respects, was, after all, without true discipline,
and presented many glaring incongruities.
Thus, whatever he had of
what could really be named ambition
was satisfied when he had surprised us
'soundsers;' and our praise&mdash;and we
lavished it upon him in full measure, as
we knew he liked it&mdash;was all the praise
he seemed to desire. Then, he was altogether
one of us in his notions of pleasure
and recreation. Like the rest of us,
he cordially appreciated the sparkling
product of the New England distilleries,
and far more than any of us&mdash;to such
a pitch did his animal spirits rule&mdash;he
relished our broad sea-side jokes and
songs, and as well our rattling jigs and
hornpipes. As for others attempting to
elevate him to a more exalted station,
the thing was simply impossible. When
led of his own accord to seek other society
than ours, he could by no means
content himself with the companionship
of staid practical persons, who on account
of his latent worth would have
readily countenanced, and with the least
opportunity even served him, but he invariably
paid his court to adventurers;
such creatures, for instance, as seedy
'professors' of one kind or another, who,
in the inevitable shawl and threadbare
suit of black, were constantly dismounting
at the village tavern, with proposals
either to 'lecture' on something, or
'teach' somewhat, as the case might
happen to be, and who, having no affinity
whatever with the brawny, awkward
Viking who fondly hung on their shabby-genteel
skirts, amused themselves at his
greenness, or pooh-pooh'd him altogether,
as they saw fit. And when, as it not unfrequently
happened, official and influential
individuals at a distance were
moved by the story of his renown to pay
him their respects in person, and listen
courteously and gravely to his opinions,
his discrimination stood him in no better
stead, for as soon as he possibly could
he bent the conference towards a sailor's
revel, and astonished his stately visitants
by singing the spiciest songs, and sometimes
even by a Terpsichorean display
in full costume; for he was excessively
proud of his accomplishments in this
line, and implicitly believed that the
shaking of his elephantine limbs, and the
whirling of his broad, coatless flanks,
formed a spectacle so tasteful and entertaining,
that no one could fail to enjoy
it to the utmost. Assuredly I have
now said enough as to old Bill's incapacities
for a grander role in life. In
reality that part of a lofty manhood to
which he at first sight seemed fitted, was
not his; for, properly speaking, he was
not an actual man, but a boy&mdash;a grand
and glorious boy, if you will, but yet a
very boy; and at length he met the fate
of a boy, as we shall learn.</p>

<p>Once more we were engaged upon a
wreck. But this time it was in no hyperborean
tempest that we were called
forth, but when the very sweetest airs
of June were blowing. The case demanding
our aid was that of a wrecking
schooner which had gaily left her
moorings in New York harbor to pick
up a summer's living along the coast,
but had inadvertently cut up some of
her capers rather too near our beach,
and so with one fine ebb tide found herself
stranded. As it was an instance of
sickness in the regularly graduated and
scientific college itself, our whole shore
was intensely 'tickled' at the accident.
And again, as this doctress, like many
another ailing leech, was quite incapable
of curing her own suffering, her toddy-blossom-faced
bully of a New York captain
was pleased to salute old Bill with
cup high in air, and beg that he would
take a sufficient force and heave the
distressed craft into deep water. Thus
a crew of us were called together and

set to work at the vessel. As the
weather was so warm and beautiful, and
as bed and board were at this time to
be had on the beach, we agreed among
us that our convenience would be the
better served by taking up our temporary
quarters near the scene of our labors.
Now, the place where we were
offered the necessary accommodation
consisted of an ancient plank-built tenement,
which stood behind a sand-ridge
that a far younger Atlantic than ours
had piled up, and then, retreating, abandoned.
In winter this rude domicile was
bare and tenantless; but in the summer
months it was usually occupied by some
thriftless gammer or gaffer from the
main-land, who, having stocked it with
a few of the coarsest household goods,
and whatever provisions came to hand,
offered entertainment to such wreckers
and 'soundsers' as happened to be in
its vicinity. The present incumbent of
the hostel was a woman, claiming to be
a widow, of the name of Rose; bearing
in most respects no resemblance whatever
to any of her predecessors. Where
she was born, or had hitherto resided,
none of us knew: all that gossip could,
gather was that she had unexpectedly
descended from a passing vessel with
her effects and entered directly the
abandoned house. When questioned as
to the scene of her earlier life, she
vaguely gave answer that she had disported
herself largely in 'Philadelphy;'
but as no 'Philadelphy' woman that
ever walked through a doorway was or
is able to compound a chowder or bake
a clam pie worthy of the name, and as
Madame Rose understood how to prepare
both these luxuries to a charm, her
statement must have been false; she was,
undoubtedly, a 'coast-wise' lady, and
one who knew who Jack was as well as
he himself did. Her appearance was,
on the whole, agreeable. She was tall,
slender, of regular features, and, though
indisputably on the shady side of forty,
was still free from any signs that would
proclaim her charms to be on the wane.
I remember in particular that she had
long, white and regular teeth, thereby
strongly contrasting with our native women,
who as a rule lose their teeth early.
Her manners were very novel to us.
She was invariably of a simpering, ducking
turn, and interlarded her curt speech
with curiously hard words. In dress she
carried matters with an incomparably
high hand. She wore hoops 'all day
long,'&mdash;a freak then never even so
much as thought of in our village,&mdash;adorned
her fingers with many rings,
and her throat with large florid brooches,
and in the evening, after having brought
her household duties to a close, sat here
or there with her sewing, in silks (though
perhaps not of the newest), or other
highly-civilized stuffs.</p>

<p>Most of our crew regarded their hostess
with greatly mingled feelings; but
old Bill entertained but one sentiment
for her,&mdash;that of unqualified admiration.
As we only 'wrought' at the
stranded schooner on the high water,&mdash;some
five hours out of the twenty-four,&mdash;he
had plenty of opportunity to dangle
after his dearie, and did so unremittingly.
While the rest of us were either
napping, dancing the lively 'straight
four,' hunting herns' eggs among the
sand-hills, and so on, according to our
inclination, he, in far more romantic
mood, seized all possible opportunities
to quickly gather fire-wood for his
charmer, fill her tea-kettle, open whatever
clams and oysters she was about to
cook, and, above all, to recount for her
delight one of those inimitable yarns of
his, at whose points he himself was sure
to laugh till the rafters of the house
shook and the plates in the dresser rattled
again. But this was merely the
first stage of his passion. Before long,
as is not unusual in such cases, it took
another and more bodeful turn. That
inextinguishable laughter of his was
heard no more, or at best gave place to
a feeble tittering; his stories dropped
from his lips with but flat pungency;
and instead of performing his lady-love's
'chores' with a mirthful readiness,
he went through them in a heartsick
way, the while directing towards
her furtive looks of supplication. The

true state of matters was now obvious
to all Old Bill was another fatally-stricken
victim of that spooney archer-boy
who next to death holds dominion
over men; and with his case, thus momentous,
we could but feel a renewed
interest in his behalf, and busy our
tongues about him. I, for my part,
thought that as he was a widower, and
needful of a wife to comfort him in his
advancing age, and that as the present
object of his affections, if not a highly

'forcible' woman, seemed at all events
to be one of whom no great harm was to
be feared, there could be no valid objection
to his being joined to her; particularly
if nothing was divulged proving
her to be other than what she seemed.
But this view I found to be on the whole
unacceptable to my auditory. Almost
to a man they condemned the propriety
of the match. It could not actually be
said that they disliked Mrs. Hose, but
they were jealous of her, as, in her manner
and style of array, she considerably
dimmed the lustre of their own women;
and they distrusted her as she was a
stranger; it being a marked habit with
most of our folks to distrust all strangers
save those from whom they expect pecuniary
awards. But meanwhile, notwithstanding
this criticism, the little
idyl in our midst was developing itself
apace. On the afternoon of one beautiful
Sunday, a day in which we of
course ordinarily did no work, when
the dinner-table had been well cleared
away, what should we see but old Bill
swinging forth with his sailor gait from
the house, and arrayed as jauntily as his
check shirt and pea-jacket (his only suit
of apparel at hand) would permit, to be
speedily followed by Mrs. Rose, who
with one set of finger-tips held up the
light folds of a sweetly blue lawn skirt,
and with the other bore aslant before
her a bewitching pink parasol. Undoubtedly
there was a great indulgence
in sly winks and suppressed titterings
on the part of such of us as chanced to
be witnesses of this at once festal and
sentimental sally; but the twain heeded
naught whatsoever of these manifestations,
but struck off along the snow-white
strand where the sea was droning its
hymn so lazily that it would have inevitably
put itself to sleep, if the fish-hawks
had not so continually disturbed it by
mischievously diving headlong into its
bosom. At last they returned again;
and we soon became aware that the
stroll had not been without great results
to both; since Mrs. Rose affected to be
laboring under a high degree of emotion,
and retired to the privacy of her apartment,
while old Bill was by no means
the dolorous swain of a few hours before,
but, making his way among us, with his
wide mouth stretching its best, proceeded
formally to shake hands with one and
all as though he had finally got back from
a long and arduous voyage; and then,
merrily calling for a certain brown jug
which was among our stores, removed
the corn-cob which served as a cork,
and having wetted his great heart with
a draught which I have no doubt measured
a full pint, fell, entirely regardless
of the day, to performing his most spirited
hoe-down, while the most of us looked
on with a mirth that knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Yes, old Bill was now 'a happy man,'
Mrs. Rose could but accept such a suitor
as he, if but from the fact that; his ardor
and his pain were of the freshest complexion,
and of an amplitude fully proportioned
to that of his extraordinary
physical bulk. As we tendered him our
congratulations upon his happy state, he
received the courtesy with extreme complacency.
But, to tell the truth, those
who did thus congratulate him were but
few. Most of the men remained of their
old mind as to the proposed match; indeed,
I ere long found that they looked
upon it with less favor than ever. It
appeared that they had been inflamed
with a rumor that Mrs. Rose intended
to beguile her adorer to a foreign shore,
where a scion or two of her brilliant
house found happy sustenance; and that
nothing but evil could accrue from such
an act, was of course as clear as noonday.
Now, when I came to trace this
rumor to its source, I became apprised
that it owed its publicity to an old man

of our number known by the nickname
of 'Mister,' who was remarkable for a
rare amount of credulity, self-conceit,
and obstinacy, and at the same time for
being the invariable butt of his company.
This wiseacre averred that he
had succeeded in wringing from Mrs.
Rose the confession that directly she and
old Bill were made man and wife, they
were to depart for Hatteras Inlet, on the
coast of North Carolina, where the lady
gay possessed 'relations;' and this narrative,
wofully muttered about among
our crew, and accompanied with a due
amount of sighs and head-shakings, had
depressed them most fearfully, not withstanding
the character of the narrator.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was, that most
of the men were actually desirous that
a betrothal, contracted directly in the
face of public opinion, and without the
smallest deference to anybody, as that of
old Bill and Mrs. Rose had been, should
come to some kind of grief or other, and
they were fain to believe that it would
do so. As for me, I was without true
concern on the subject, as I had ever
been. If it should indeed fall out that
old Bill was to take a trip to Hatteras
with his bride, I was convinced that he
would enjoy himself famously among the
great abundance of fish and game said
to abound in that place, and that in the
end he would return to us again, to rule
over us in greater splendor than ever;
as for his sweetheart or any of her like
doing him any actual injury, the idea
seemed so preposterous to me, that whenever
an opportunity presented itself I
did not fail to ridicule it to the utmost.
Still, in order to do my whole duty in
the matter, I hastened to impress old
Bill with the importance of his becoming
acquainted with the antecedents of
his lady-love, and thus saving himself
from the possibility of a misstep. But
this counsel did no farther good than to
bring a clouded brow to my dear old
friend, and so I did not persist in it.
Indeed, we communed together but little
more in any way; for very shortly
after he resigned his place as our 'boss,'
and left post-haste for the main-land.
Here, as was revealed to me in due season,
he amazed the neighborhood by incontinently
renting his farmstead to a
son with whom he had been on indifferent
terms for years; dispatching his
daughter, who had heretofore acted as
his housekeeper, off to a distant town
to become an apprentice to a milliner's
trade; and stowing his clothes and a
shot-bag of hard money which he was
known to possess into a sailor's chest,
with which, together with his gun and a
Methodist preacher, he again hurried off
for the asylum of his beloved. Arrived
once more in the witching presence, he
waited till evening (yet how he was
constrained so to do is more than I can
tell), and then, as we made it a duty to
be gathered about him once more, the
wedding took place.</p>

<p>The occasion was one of such interest,
that the preacher could but make the
most of it. After the nuptial benediction
had been pronounced, he straightway
launched forth into a homily of
such graciousness and force, that but
few of us missed being forcibly wrought
upon, while Mrs. Rose was stirred apparently
to the depths of her being.
On the day succeeding the marriage,
our light-hearted Benedict abandoned
himself to another jollification. But the
next morning, a schooner headed in
towards the beach, and, slackening the
peaks of her sails, sent ashore a yawl,
whose crew saluted Mrs. Rose as an old
and familiar friend, and with whose apparition,
without the least regard as to
what shift we wreckers were to make, a
great packing was begun in the house.
Bedsteads were taken down, beds were
bundled up in sheets, crockery was thrust
away in barrels, and all borne one after
the other to the yawl, where the bride,
with her potent parasol full spread, and
pretending to shudder at the sight of the
gently heaving breakers through which
she was soon to pass, mincingly threw
herself in the thick of the luggage, and
old Bill mounted the stern, with his
huge palm extended for a good-by
shake. 'Good-by, old chap,' said I, as
I took his hand the last of all, 'good-by!

You're not half mean enough to
stay away from us forever; so in the
meantime do your best to show the Hatteras
boys what a nice thing it is to be
somebody in the world!' And thus the
boat put off, and, reaching the schooner
in a few moments, was hoisted to her
decks. In a few moments more the
vessel had reset her sails, and, with a
free wind, bore straight to the southward
out of sight.</p>

<p>Now comes the singular part of my
story. In a few weeks from the time of
their sailing, we heard that old Bill and
his wife had safely landed at Hatteras
Inlet, and rented a small house on one
of the beaches there, with the intention
of opening a kind of tavern; but no
sooner were they fairly settled in their
new abode than old Bill was found one
morning <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">dead in his bed</span>, with evident
signs of having met with foul play;
though what kind of death these indications
pointed at was very uncertain.</p>

<p>The closest and shrewdest investigation
failed to attach a well-grounded
suspicion to any one. Poor Bill was
dead&mdash;and nothing more was ever
known. Singular enough, the conduct
of his widow was such as to entirely
avert even from her enemies hints of
complicity in the crime,&mdash;if crime there
was,&mdash;though none doubted that there
had been a murder, and that murder in
a few attendant circumstances seemed
to indicate female aid. Shortly after this
catastrophe, Madame Rose made 'a vendue'
of her deceased husband's gun and
apparel, packed up her own worldly
goods, and vanished, to be heard of no
more.</p>

<p>And so our shore lost its best 'soundser'&mdash;a
man of mark in his way, great
of frame and heart, and one long to be
recalled in our humble annals of wrecking
and of sport. He was one of those
vigorous out-croppings of sturdy Northern
physique recalling in minute detail
the stories told of those giant children,
the Vikings and Goths of the fighting
ages, and which the blood, though as
healthy as ever,&mdash;witness the glorious
exploits of our soldiers even as I write,&mdash;produces
less frequently in these days
of culture. Such as I have described
was the character of Bill the Soundser,
and such was literally and truly his mysterious
death.</p>

<h2>General Lyon.</h2>


<p>To-day all the Northland shouts for
joy, flashes its announcements of victory
along myriad leagues of wire, hurls
them from grim cannon mouths out over
broad bays till the seas tremble with
sympathy, huzzas in the streets, flames
in bonfires, would even clash the clouds
together and streak the heavens with
lightning&mdash;and for what? The flag
waves again in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama,
Arkansas, and the cause is safe!
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">The cause</span>&mdash;have we all learned what
that means, brother Americans? Something
broader than mere Union, the
pass-word of so many thousands to suffering
and death, something more than
the freedom of the press and the ballot-box.
It means Progress; and until we
acknowledge this, all freedom is a vast
injustice, luring men on to Beulahs which
Fate&mdash;the fate they worship&mdash;will never
have them reach. It would be little
enough to regain our foothold upon
Southern territory, or repossess Southern
forts, even if forts and territory have
been wrested from us by treason and perjury,
if with every mile of advance we
did not gain a stronghold of principle.
We are not straining every nerve, struggling
under immense financial burdens,
wrenching away tender household ties,
sacrificing cheerfully and eagerly private
interests, brilliant prospects, and
high hopes, only to prove that twenty
millions of men are physically stronger
than twelve. God forbid! This is no
latter-day Olympic game, whoso victors
are to be rewarded with the applause
of a party or a generation. All the
dead heroes and martyrs of the past will
crowd forward to offer their unheard
thanks; all the years to come will embalm
with blessings the memory of the
patriots who open the door to wide advancement,
prosperous growth, and high
activity of a universal intelligence.</p>

<p>And among these brave men, whom
the world shall delight to honor, let our
deepest grief and our justest pride be
for LYON. We have given his honest
life too little notice;&mdash;this man whose
sincerity was equalled only by his zeal;
who, in a rarely surpassed spirit of self-abnegation,
was content to lie down and
die in the first heat of the great conflict,
and to leave behind for more favored
comrades the triumphal arches and rose-strewn
paths of victory. The world has
known no truer martyr than he who fell
at Wilson's Creek, August 10th, 1861.</p>

<p>'The history of every man paints his
character,' says Goethe; and scanty and
imperfect as are the recorded details of
General Lyon's life, enough is known to
prove him to have been high-minded
and brave as a soldier, with a perseverance
and a penetration that analyzed at
once the platforms of contending factions,
and read in their elements the
principles which are to govern the future
of our nation.</p>

<p>He came of the stout Knowlton stock
of Connecticut, a family of whom more
than one served England in the old
French war, and afterward distinguished
themselves against her in the Revolution.
We hear of the gallant Captain Knowlton
at Bunker Hill, throwing up, in default
of cotton, the breastwork of hay,
which proved such an efficient protection
to the provincials during the battle.
Once more he appears as colonel, at
Harlem Plains, rushing with his Rangers
('Congress' Own') upon the enemy on
the Plains, and, cut off shortly from retreat
by reinforcements, fighting bravely
between the foes before and their reserves
behind, and, falling at last, borne
away by sorrowing comrades, and buried
at sunset within the embankments. 'A
brave man,' wrote Washington, 'who
would have been an honor to any country.'

With the memory of such a hero
engrafted upon his earliest childhood,
we can not wonder at the bent of the
boy Lyon's inclinations. 'Daring and

resolute, and wonderfully attached to
his mother,' it is easy to imagine what
lessons of endurance and decision he
learned from her, whose just inheritance
was the stout-hearted patriotism that
had flowered into valorous deeds in her
kindred, and was destined to live again
in her son. It was, an ordinary childhood,
and a busy, uneventful youth,
passed for the most part in the old red
farm-house nestled between two rocky
hills near Eastport, where he was born.
In 1837 he entered the Military Academy
at West Point, and was a graduate,
with distinction, four years later. Of
the years immediately following, we have
little information; but we can fancy the
young soldier laying, in his obscurity,
the foundation for that practical military
knowledge which so eminently distinguished
his late brilliant career. During
his years of service in the Everglades
of Florida, and on our Western frontier,
he had ample opportunity to gain a thorough
insight into his profession.</p>

<p>He first appears in the history of the
country in the Mexican war, is present
at the bombardment of Vera Cruz,
dashes after the enemy at Cerro Gordo,
capturing on the crest of the hill a battery
which he turns upon the discomfited
foe. At Contreras his command
proves as impenetrable as a phalanx of
Alexander; and when at last the victorious
Americans fight their way into Mexico,
the city of fabulous treasures and associations
well-nigh classical, for the first
time he receives a wound. He was breveted
captain for his gallantry at Cherubusco,
and at the end of the war received
the rank of full captain, and was ordered
with his regiment to California. No appointment
could have been more felicitous.
In the guerilla mode of warfare
demanded by the peculiar nature of the
country and its inhabitants, his habits of
quick decision, and the experience of a
war with an enemy equally unscrupulous
though less undisciplined, were absolutely
invaluable. Here was no scope
for the conception and excitation of
deep-laid schemes; the movements of the
enemy were too rapid. Plans that would
elsewhere have been matured only in
the process of a long campaign, were
here often originated and completed in
a single night. Simple strategy was
of more avail than the most intricate
display of military science, and the impulse
of a moment more to be relied upon
than the prudent forethought of a
month. He had to combat, in the newly-acquired
territory, the cunning of tribes
whose natural ferocity was sharpened
into vindictiveness by the encroachments
upon their soil of a new and
strange people; and every association
with the intruders, who were for the
most part men of little reputation and
less principle, had developed in the Indians
only the fiercest and most decided
animosity. To encounter their vigilance
with watchfulness as alert, to confound
their swift counsels with sudden alarm,
to penetrate their ambuscades and anticipate
their cunning with incessant activity,
to be, in short, ubiquitous, was
the duty of Captain Lyon.</p>

<p>After years spent in the uncertain
tactics of this half barbaric warfare, he
was removed, in the height of political
strife in Kansas, to its very centre.
Here, while comparatively free from the
wearisome requirements of active service
such as had been demanded in California,
and at a time when events the
most portentous proved clearly to the
great minds of the country the advance
of a political crisis whose consequences
must be most important, involving&mdash;should
deep-laid conspiracy be successful&mdash;the
bankruptcy of principle and
that high-handed outrage, the triumph,
of a minority,&mdash;Captain Lyon had full
liberty and abundant opportunity to settle
for himself the great questions mooted
in the Missouri Compromises, the Lecompton
Constitutions and the Dred
Scott decisions of the day. To a mind
unprejudiced, except as the honest impulses
of every honest man's heart are
always prejudiced in favor of the right,
there was but a single decision. Disgusted
with the heartless policy which
democracy had for so many years pursued,
and which now threatened to culminate

either in its utter degradation at
the North, or in the establishment in the
South of an oligarchy which would annihilate
all free action and suppress all free
opinion, he severed his connection with
that party,&mdash;a step to which he was
also impelled by the injustice that was
then seeking to force upon the people
of Kansas an institution which they condemned
as unproductive and expensive,
to say nothing of their moral repugnance
to the very A B C of its principles.
It was at this time that Captain
Lyon contributed to the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Manhattan Express</span>,
a weekly journal of the neighborhood,
a series of papers in which he took
an earnest, manly and decided stand in
favor of the principles which his thoughtful
mind recognized as alone 'reliable,'

and harmonious with the grand design
and end of the great Republic of the
West. To these articles we shall hereafter
refer, at present hastening through
the career, so striking and so sad, which
a few brief months cut short, leaving
only the memory of General Lyon as a
legacy to the country his single aim and
wise counsels would have saved.</p>

<p>The guns of Fort Sumter had flashed
along our coast an appeal whose force
no words can ever compute. The days
had been busy with the assembling of
armies, the nights restless with their solemn
marches, and forge and factory
rang with the strokes of the hammer
and the whirr of flying shafts, whose
echoes seemed measured to the air of
some new Marseillaise. From our homes
rushed forth sons, husbands, brothers,
fathers, followed by the prayers and
blessings of dear women, who yielded
them early but willingly to their country.
And while regiments clustered
along the Potomac, and Washington lay
entrenched behind white lines of tents,
we find our soldier, fresh from Kansas
strifes, in command of the United States
Arsenal at St. Louis; and to his prompt
action and decided measures at this important
juncture the early success of the
Union cause in Missouri is to be attributed.
For a time St. Louis was the theatre
of action. The police commissioners,
backed by Governor and Legislature,
in the demanded the removal of the Union
troops from the grounds of the arsenal,
claiming it as the exclusive property of
the State, and asserting that the authority
usurped by the general government
as but a partial sovereignty, and limited
to the occupation, for purposes exclusively
military, of the certain tracts of
land now pending in this novel court of
chancery. This highly enigmatical exposition
of State rights, pompous and inflated
though it was, failed to convince
or convert Captain Lyon, who, being
unable to detect, in his occupancy of the
arsenal, any exaggeration of the rights
vested by the Constitution in the general
government, declined to abandon his
post, and proceeded to call out the Home
Guard, then awaiting the arrival of General
Harney, and temporarily under his
command. His little army of ten thousand
men was then drawn up upon the
heights commanding Camp Jackson, then
occupied by the Missouri militia under
Col. Frost, whoso command had been
increased by the addition of numerous
individuals of avowed secession principles.
Uninfluenced by the reception of
a note from this officer asserting his integrity
and his purpose to defend the
property of the United States, and disavowing
all intention hostile to the force
at the arsenal, Captain Lyon replied
by a peremptory summons for an unconditional
surrender. He found it incredible
that a body assembled at the instigation
of a traitorous governor, and
acting under his instructions and according
to the 'unparalleled legislation' of a
traitorous legislature, receiving under
the flag of the Confederate States munitions
of war but lately the acknowledged
property of the general government,
could have any other than the
as most unfriendly designs upon its enemies.
The force of Camp Jackson (which
notwithstanding its professed character,
boasted its streets Beauregard and Davis)
being numerically inferior, and perhaps
not entirely prepared to do battle
for a cause whose legitimacy must still
have been a question with many of

them, decided, after a council of war,
to comply with the demands of Capt.
Lyon, and became his prisoners. A few
days afterward General Harney arrived,
and Captain Lyon was elected Brigadier
General by the 1st Brigade Missouri
Volunteers.</p>

<p>Convinced of the imminence of the
crisis and the peril of delay, Gen. Lyon
immediately commenced active operations
against the secessionists at Potosi,
and ordered the seizure of the steamer
which had supplied the offensive army
with material of war from the United
States property at Baton Rouge. In
the meantime, Gen. Harney, with a
culpable blindness, had made an extraordinary
arrangement with Gen. Price,
by which he pledged himself to desist
from military movements so long as the
command of Gen. Price was able to preserve
order in the State. Upon his removal
by the authorities at Washington,
nine days later, Gen. Lyon was left in
command of the department. At this
time the rebel general took occasion, in
a proclamation to the people of Missouri,
to feel assured that 'the successor of Gen.
Harney would certainly consider himself
and his government in honor bound
to carry out this agreement (the Harney-Price)
in good faith.' But his assurance
was without foundation. The
temper of the new commander had been
tried in the Camp Jackson affair, and an
interview between Price, Jackson and
other prominent secessionists and Gen.
Lyon, resulted, after a few hours' consultation,
in the declaration of the Union
general that the authority of his government
would be upheld at any cost and
its property protected at all hazards.
Three days later, Jackson fled to Booneville,
fearing an attack upon Jefferson
City, which was immediately occupied
by Gen. Lyon, who was received with
acclamation by the citizens. Unwilling
to grant by delay what he had refused to
an underhand diplomacy,&mdash;opportunity
to the enemy to possess the government
property, or entrench themselves strongly
in their new quarters,&mdash;the general,
with characteristic promptness, ordered
an advance upon Booneville. The rebel
force was stationed above Rockport, but
retreated, after a skirmish which did not
assume the proportions of a battle; and
the Union army, two thousand strong,
entered the town, where the national
colors and the welcomes of the inhabitants
testified their joy at the change.</p>

<p>The army of General Lyon, amounting
at one time to ten thousand, had
decreased by the first of August&mdash;the
term of enlistment of many of the soldiers
having expired&mdash;to six thousand;
and it was with this number that, having
swept the south-west, and believing
the enemy intended to attack him at
Springfield, he advanced to meet them
at Dug Springs. The army of the enemy
was larger and their position a
strong one, but they were unable to hold
it, and, after a sharp skirmish, fled in disorder,
while Gen. Lyon continued his
march toward Springfield. His situation
had now become a critical one.
The reinforcements for which he had telegraphed
in vain, and in vain sent messengers
to entreat from the chief of the
department, Gen. Fremont, then in St.
Louis, did not arrive. His army was
subsisting on half rations, and wearied
with exhausting marches over the uneven
country in the extreme heat of
midsummer. And now, for the first time,
hope seemed to desert the general. Under
his direction the cause had hitherto
triumphed in Missouri. Now, with zeal
unabated and courage unflinching, he
must fall before the enemy he had so
successfully opposed, or retreat where retreat
was disaster, disgrace, and defeat.
No wonder that, as from day to day he
looked for the expected aid as men in
drought for the clouds that are to bless
them, he grew restless and perplexed
and despairing; no wonder that the face
that had never before worn the lines of
indecision, should now lose its accustomed
cheerfulness and glance of calm purpose,
and challenge sympathy and pity for the
heart that had never before asked more
than admiration and respect. He felt
that the hour had its demands, and that
they must be met. Action, even in the

face of disaster, was less a defeat than
an inglorious retirement. The public,
surely unaware of the fearful odds against
him, clamored for an engagement; the
State expected it of its hero; the government
awaited it, and with a brave
heart, but no hope, Gen. Lyon prepared
for the attack. The result all the world
knows. Was it a victory where the conquerors
were obliged to retire from the
field, and carry out their wounded under
a flag of truce? Was it a defeat
where the enemy had been thrice repulsed,
once driven from the ground,
had burned their baggage train, and
made no pursuit of the retreating army?</p>

<p>But most mournful are those last moments
of the faithful soldier's life; most
solemn those last tones of his voice as
his orders rang out on that misty morning
amid the smoke and shouts of the
battle-field. He stands here bare-headed,
the blood streaming from two wounds
which he does not heed, the cloud of
perplexity settling over his face like a
pall, his troubled eyes fixed upon the
enemy. He turns to head a regiment
which has lost its colonel&mdash;"Forward!
men; I will lead you!" A moment, and
he lies there: no more striving for victory
here; no more anxious hours of weary
watching for the succor that never
came; no more goadings from an exacting
public, nor any more appeals to an
unheeding chief. Even the triumphant
hush of life could not smooth out those
lines cut by unwonted care upon his
face, or answer the mute questioning of
that painful indecision there. So from
the West they brought him, by solemn
marches, to the East, and colors hung at
half-mast, and bells were tolled as the
flag-draped hero was borne slowly by.
And to the music of tender dirges, he,
whose whole life had been, inspired by
the whistling of fifes and rolling of drums,
was laid to rest. A handful of clods falling
upon his breast, their hollow sound
never thrilling the mother heart that lay
again so near her son's, a volley fired
over the grave, and all was over. Of all
the brave men gone, no fate has seemed
to us so sad. Winthrop, young and ardent,
with the tide of great thoughts rashing
in upon his princely heart, died in
the flush of hope with the fresh enthusiasm
of poetry and undimmed patriotism
shining in his eyes, and we laid our soldier
to sleep under the violets. Ellsworth
fell forward with the captured flag
of treason in his hand, and the whole
nation cheering him on in his early sally
upon the 'sacred' Virginia soil. Brave
and honorable, with fine powers cultured
by study and earnest thought, death
took from him no portion of the fame
life would have awarded him. Baker
rode into the jaws of death in that fatal
autumn blunder; but the ignominy of defeat
rested upon other shoulders. His
only to obey, even while 'all the world
wondered.' But he did not fall before
the honor of a country's admiration and
the meed of her grateful thanks were
his. Soldier, orator and statesman, he
had gained in a brilliant career a glory
earned by few, and could well afford to
die, assured of a memory justified from
all reproach. But to Lyon, whom there
were so few to mourn, death in the
midst of anticipated defeat was bitter
indeed. No time to retrieve the losses
and disasters the cruel remissness of others
had entailed upon him; the fruit of
the anxious toil of months wrested from
him even as it began to ripen; all his glad
hopes chilled by suspicion, but his faith,
we may well believe, still strong in the
ultimate success of the cause he loved.
A whole life he had given to his country,
and she had not thought it worth
while to redeem it from disgrace with the
few thousands that he asked. He had outlived
the elasticity of youth, when wrongs
are quickly remedied, and new impulses
spring, like phoenixes, from the ashes of
the old. Uncertain whether he were
the victim of a conspiracy, the tool of
a faction, or the martyr to some unknown
theory, he died, and as the country had
been to him wife and children, he left
her his all.</p>

<p>It was known to but few that the
soldier, whose career had been rather
useful than brilliant, had, when the
scheming of politicians and their doubly-refined

arguments threatened to deceive
and ruin the country, put by his sword
and taken up the pen. In a series of articles,
short, concise, and to the point, he
effectually canvassed the State. They
are addressed to thinking men everywhere.
Free from all trickery, strictly
impartial, relying entirely upon the
soundness of his premises for success,&mdash;for
elegance of diction he had not, and
he was too honest even to become a sophist,&mdash;these
papers manifest at once the
true patriot and the intelligent man.
Thousands of adherents the Republican
cause had in 1860, but not one more indefatigable
or more heartily in earnest
than Lyon. Outside the limits of party
interests, and uninfluenced personally by
the predominance of either faction, he
had worked out in his own way the problem
of national life, and now spread its
solution before his readers. 'Our cause,'
said he, 'is to honor labor and elevate
the laborer.' Here we have the kernel
of the whole matter; the spirit, if not the
letter, of the whole republican system of
government. The secret that philosophers
have elaborated from the unconquerable
facts of physics, ethics, and
psychology, that men of genius have
evolved with infinite difficulty from the
mass of crude aesthetic associations that
cluster around every object of nature or
of art, Lyon, working and thinking alone
as a citizen, has discovered, with the
sole aid of common sense and the habit
of practical observation. Carey and
Godwin have proved by statistics for
unbelievers the reasonableness of the
doctrine enunciated by Lyon. Now,
thanks to the untiring efforts of a few
stout-hearted patriots, it is no new one
to the North; but in the late presidential
contest it was a strange weapon glittering
in strong hands. Our society, diluted
and weakened by the Southern element,
revolted at first from the creed
that is to prove its salvation. Not alone
in our border States had the dragon crept,
searing our fair institutions with his hot
breath, but even upon the sturdy old
Puritan stock were engrafted many of the
petty notions that pass for 'principles'
in Dixie. True, we were educated, all
of us, into a sort of decent regard for
the good old element of labor,&mdash;we call
it industry,&mdash;more antique, since antiquity
is a virtue, than aristocracy, for it
began in Paradise. But this was a feature
of our Northern character that was
to be hurried out of sight, ignominiously
buried without candle or bell, when
the giant of Southern chivalry stalked
across our borders. The bravado and
gentlemanly ruffianism of youthful F.F.V-ism
at college, and the supercilious condescension
of incipient Southern belledom
in the seminary, impressed young
North America with a respect that was
indeed unacknowledged, but that grew
with its growth and strengthened with
its strength. But this mock romance of
ancestry, this arrogant assumption by
the South of all the social virtues and
courtesies of which the nation, or indeed
the universe, could boast, was like the
flash of an expiring candle to Lyon. He
had little to do with first families North
or South; his mission was to the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">people</span>.
His practical mind gathered in, sheaf
after sheaf, a whole harvest of political
facts. He saw that the government of
the United States, originally intended
to be administered by the people, had
been for years in the power of the minority.
Against this perversion of the
purpose of the founders of the republic,
this outrage to the memory of men who
labored for its defense and welfare, he
entered his earnest protest. The shallow
effort of the Democratic party to
establish upon constitutional grounds the
monstrous phantom of justice they called
government, was met by his hearty indignation.
He says, 'With the artfulness
of a deity and the presumption of a
fiend, our own Constitution is perversely
claimed by the Democracy as the gis
for the establishment of a slave autocracy
over our country.'</p>

<p>No element more fatal to our growth
or freedom could Lyon conceive than
this slave autocracy. It sapped the
very foundations of republicanism, and,
stealthily advancing to the extreme limits
of the law, enjoyed the confidence of

the people, while it plotted their subjugation.
All the varied machinery of the
new social system, falsely styled government,
had for its object the extinction
of individual rights and the deification
of capital. Church and state united in
the unholy effort to Crush the masses,
and intriguing politicians, by dint of dazzling
rhetoric and plausible promises,
lured the people on to secure their own
downfall at the polls. The only remedy
for this Lyon saw in the elevation of
the masses. 'It is the greatest political
revolution yet to be effected,' he says,
'to bring the laboring man to know that
honest industry is the highest of merits,
and should be awarded the highest
honor; and, properly pursued, contributes
to his intelligence and morality,
and to the virtues needed for official
station.' 'The calamity,' says an eminent
writer from his far Platonean
heights, 'is the masses;' but liberty is a
new religion that is to sweep over the
world and regenerate them. And to
this end Lyon boldly advocated emancipation
for the sake of the white man.
If to-day, when patriotism is at a premium,
men tremble before the acknowledged
necessity of this measure, and are
either too cowardly or too indolent to
meet the demands of the times, it required
no little boldness in 1860 to advance
a theory so decided, even in a
Kansas newspaper. But Lyon knew
the inefficiency of half-way measures,
and the moral degradation they inevitably
entail upon the community so weak
or so deluded as to adopt them. The
hue and cry of abolitionism did not disturb
him; he was not afraid of names.
Conservatism that sat in state at Washington,
and pulled the wires all over the
country,&mdash;a tremendous power, none
the less fearful in that it was only a galvanized
one,&mdash;was a dead letter to
him, its dignity departed with the age
that had demanded it. Conservatism
would have resented no impositions, established
no new landmarks, asserted
no independence; would carry its mails
on horseback, creep over the ocean in
schooners, fight by sea in piked brigantines,
and by land with spear and battle-axe;
it would have emancipated no
slaves in Great Britain and France, and
no serfs in Russia. But if freedom means
anything, it means <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Progress</span>,&mdash;liberty
to advance, never to retrograde. 'Nothing
in the world will ever go backward,'

said the old lizard to Heine. All the
authority of a new Areopagus could
never sanction that; and yet this liberty
the South claims, nay, has already acted
upon, so that the world may see the result
of the experiment, and against its
continuance Lyon protests. In the long
silent years of preparation for the fray
he has nursed strange thoughts on the
ultimate destiny of man. He has seen
in dreams, prophetic of a mighty accomplishment,
his country growing great,
and vigorous, and powerful, extending
to struggling humanity everywhere the
protection of her friendship, building up
noble institutions, encouraging science
and the useful arts, and leading the van
in the world's great millennial march;
and this not through any miraculous interposition
of Providence, but by means
of an exalted intelligence and the power
of thought stimulating to action, and that
of the noblest kind.</p>

<p>But you argue the unfitness of the
masses for this destiny. Lyon answers,&mdash;not
in any musically-rounded sentences,
in phrases nicely balanced; the
man is plain and outspoken,&mdash;'This is a
truth of philosophy and political economy,
that man rises to a condition corresponding
to the rights, duties and responsibilities
devolved upon him; and
therefore the only true way to make a
man is to invest him with the rights, duties
and responsibilities of a man, and
he generally rises in intellectual and
moral greatness to a position corresponding
to these circumstances.' It is a mistake
to suppose the great body of the
people ignorant of their position, or unconscious
of their growing importance
and dignity as representatives of a
mighty empire. Vice and poverty have
indeed well-nigh quenched humanity in

thousands in our great cities, but these
are but a drop in the ocean. Behind
lies our vast West, with its teeming
population, sturdy, active and energetic.
All our mountain districts are alive with
men who, thanks to the press, are beginning
to feel their power. Every advantage
of physical development their hardy
life gives them, and the growing consciousness
and comprehension of freedom,
blooming under a munificent free-school
dispensation, will do the rest.
Our internal manufacturing and agricultural
elements at the North, already
powerful and irrepressible, will soon exercise
a tremendous influence in our
government. Shall it be the influence
of ignorance played upon by the sophistry
of demagogues and helping to rebuild
the vicious doctrines that have
stood firmly for so many years, or the
healthful influence of intelligent industry
tending to our greatness and prosperity?
This our war is to decide.
No peaceful solution of the great question
could be made. This Lyon foresaw
in the truckling of politicians North to
win the unit of Southern political sympathy:
the main end and aim of the
South being the appointment of Southern
men to the Presidency, 'as security
on the one hand against unfavorable
executive action toward slavery, and on
the other against executive patronage
adverse to its interests, the democratic
party North succeeded, by trimming
party sails and decking party leaders,
in suiting their fastidious Southern leaders.'
The question once at issue, even
a peaceful separation was impossible,
though an amendment of the Constitution
should sanction it. War was inevitable.
The great bugbear of slavery
would still exist; fugitive slave laws be
forever upon the political carpet; formidable
jealousies spring up between two
nations founded upon such diverse principles,
yet united by very natural circumstance
of language and climate; internal
wrangling would destroy all unity,
conspiracies give the death-blow to all
prosperity and all hope of advancement.
All this if there were no great party at
the North to rise upon the vast ground
of humanity, claiming for its millions
the privilege of an unfettered life, for
its children a fair start in the future.
Only one remedy Lyon knew, and he
stood there, the early apostle of Emancipation,
and preached it. His doctrine
was not accepted then, it is not accepted
now; but the time must come, when
millions shall have been expended, and
blood shall have flowed like water only
to delay it, when we will fly to it for salvation.
Let those who still cry 'Peace,
peace,' when there is no peace, learn
what is to be its price&mdash;Emancipation.
It will be a bitter draught; well, so was
the independence of her colonies to England.
And every day makes it more bitter;
the gall in the cup rises to the brim;
a few more months and it will overflow;
the people will take the matter into their
own hands and legislate slavery into the
swamps of Florida.</p>

<p>It is a lame and blind philanthropy
that cries for a respite. 'A little more
sleep, a little more slumber. After us
the deluge.' And meanwhile the damnable
lies gain ground, and a new generation
is lost to its due development.
Have we yet to learn that we are no
longer individuals, but parts of a mighty
nation, and responsible in some sort,
every one, women and men, for its destiny?
Poland has learned this lesson.
Her eyes are upon us now. Shall she,
still struggling, find that blood and treasure,
and all the thousand dear blessings
of peace, have been sacrificed in vain?
If you cry 'War is an evil!' we grant
it; but is it reserved for the nineteenth
century to discover a creed for which
there shall be no martyrs? What great
gift has the world ever won that was
not bought with blood? When has independence
of action or thought been
purchased otherwise than at the cost of
persecution,&mdash;more revolution? Then
let us not slander revolutions. They are
the throes of nature undergoing her purification;
if it is as by fire, oh! let us
have courage and stand beside her in

her hour of trial. St. George will not
fight forever; the dragon of oppression is
dying.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Yes, although so slowly, he <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">is</span> dying;</p>

<p class="l">Many thousand years have fled in darkness,</p>
<p class="l">Since the sword first cut his scaly armor,</p>
<p class="l">And the red wound roused him into madness;</p>
<p class="l">But the good knight is of race immortal,</p>
<p class="l">Ever young, and passionate and fearless;</p>
<p class="l">And the strength which oozes from the dragon,</p>
<p class="l">Blooms reviving in the glorious warrior.'</p>
</div>

<p>And, after all, the demon of war is not
so black as we have painted him. We
do not shudder to-day as we read of the
siege of Troy or the downfall of Carthage,
or the Romance of the Cid. The
song of Deborah, 'of the avenging of
Israel <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">when the people willingly offered
themselves</span>,' is one glorious burst of praise
to God and gratitude to the martyrs.
There was war in heaven when ambition
was cast out:&mdash;what quiet pastoral
appeals to our noblest impulses as Paradise
Lost does? Wisely and well speaks
the English clergyman when he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'But the truth is that here, as elsewhere,
poetry has reached the truth,
while science and common sense have
missed it. It has distinguished&mdash;as, in
spite of all mercenary and feeble sophistry,
men ever will distinguish&mdash;war
from mere bloodshed. It has discerned
the higher feelings which lie beneath its
revolting features. Carnage is terrible.
The conversion of producers into destroyers
is a calamity. Death, and insults
to women worse than death&mdash;and
human features obliterated beneath the
hoof of the war-horse&mdash;and reeking
hospitals, and ruined commerce, and violated
homes, and broken hearts&mdash;they
are all awful. But there is something
worse than death: cowardice is worse.
And the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">decay of enthusiasm and manliness
is worse</span>. And it is worse than
death, aye, worse than one hundred
thousand deaths, when a people has
gravitated down into the creed, that the
"wealth of nations" consists, not in generous
hearts, "fire in each breast, and
freedom on each brow," in national virtues,
and primitive simplicity, and heroic
endurance, and preference of duty to
life&mdash;not in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">men</span>, but in silk and <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">cotton</span>,
and something that they call "capital."
Peace is blessed&mdash;peace arising out of
charity. But peace springing out of the
calculations of selfishness is not blessed.
If the price to be paid for peace is this,
that wealth accumulate and men decay,
better far that every street, in every
town of our once noble country, should
run blood.'<a href="#note_11"><span class="footnoteref">11</span></a></p>

<p>As we write, every telegram proves
the vaunted unity of the South a sham,
a visionary political bugbear, no longer
strong or hideous enough to frighten
the most inveterate conservative dough-face.
But a few victories do not end
the war; still earnestness and effort and
sacrifice, for the sick man of America
will fight even when his 'brains are out.'
Not until we have proved to Breckenridge,
the traitor, that we are not 'fighting
for principles that three-fourths of
us abhor,' and that the Union is not only
'a means of preserving the principles
of political liberty,' but that in it is irrevocably
bound up every living principle
of all liberty, social, religious and individual;
that in its shelter only we have
security against wrong at home and insult
from abroad; not until Emancipation
has instituted a new order of things
in society as well as in politics, will the
death of the out-spoken patriot and
brave man, Lyon, be avenged, and the
Struggle be at an end. 'Genius is patient,'
but patience has had her perfect
work, and the days of Rebellion are
numbered. On with the crusade!</p>

<h2>Maccaroni And Canvas.</h2>


<p>II.</p>

<p>The voice of Rome is baritone, always
excepting that of the Roman locomotive,&mdash;the
donkey,&mdash;which is deep
bass, and comes tearing and braying
along at times when it might well be
spared. In the still night season, wandering
among the moonlit ruins of the
Coliseum, while you pause and gaze upon
the rising tiers of crumbling stone
above you, memory retraces all you have
read of the old Roman days: the forms
of the world-conquerors once more people
the deserted ruin; the clash of ringing
steel; hot, fiery sunlight; thin, trembling
veil of dust pierced by the glaring
eyes of dying gladiators; red-spouting
blood; screams of the mangled martyrs
torn by Numidian lions; moans of the
dying; fierce shouts of exultation from
the living; smiles from gold-banded girls
in flowing robes, with floating hair, flower-crowned,
and perfumed; the hum of
thrice thirty thousand voices hushed
to a whisper as the combat hangs on an
uplifted sword; the&mdash;</p>

<p>Aw-waw-WAUN-ik! WAW-NIK!
WAUN-KI-w-a-w-n! comes like blatant
fish-horn over the silent air, and your
dream of the Coliseum ends ignominiously
with this nineteenth-century song
of a jackass.</p>

<p>At night you will hear the shrill cry
of the screech-owl sounding down the silent
streets in the most thickly-populated
parts of the city. Or you will perhaps
be aroused from sleep, as Caper often
was, by the long-drawn-out cadences of
some countryman singing a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">rondinella</span>
as he staggers along the street, fresh
from a wine-house. Nothing can be
more melancholy than the concluding
part of each verse in these rondinellas,
the voice being allowed to drop from
one note to another, as a man falling
from the roof of a very high house may
catch at some projection, hold on for a
time, grow weak, loose his hold, fall,
catch again, hold on for a minute, and
at last fall flat on the pavement, used
up, and down as low as he can reach.</p>

<p>But the street-cries of this city are
countless; from the man who brings
round the daily broccoli to the one who
has a wild boar for sale, not one but is
determined that you shall hear all about
it. Far down a narrow street you listen
to a long-drawn, melancholy howl&mdash;the
voice as of one hired to cry in the most
mournful tones for whole generations of
old pagan Romans who died unconverted;
poor devils who worshiped wine
and women, and knew nothing better
in this world. And who is their mourner?
A great, brawny, tawny, steeple-crowned
hat, blue-breeched, two-fisted
fish-huckster; and he is trying to sell,
by yelling as if his heart would break, a
basket of fish not so long as your finger.
If he cries so over anchovies, what would
he do if he had a whale for sale?</p>

<p>Another <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">primo basso profundo</span> trolls
off a wheelbarrow and a fearful cry at
the same time; not in unison with his
merchandise, for he has birds&mdash;quail,
woodcock, and snipe&mdash;for sale, besides
a string of dead nightingales, which he
says he will 'sell cheap for a nice stew.'

Think of stewed nightingales! One
would as soon think of eating a boiled
Cremona violin.</p>

<p>But out of the way! Here comes,
blocking up the narrow street, a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">contadino</span>,
a countryman from the Campagna.
His square wooden cart is drawn by a
donkey about the size of, and resembling,
save ears, a singed Newfoundland
dog; his voice, strong for a vegetarian,&mdash;for
he sells onions and broccoli, celery
and tomatoes, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">finocchio</span> and mushrooms,&mdash;is
like tearing a firm rag: how long
can it last, subjected to such use?</p>

<p>It is in the game and meat market,
near the Pantheon, that you can more
fully become acquainted with the street

cries of Rome; but the Piazza Navona
excels even this. Passing along there
one morning, Caper heard such an extraordinary
piece of vocalization, sounding
like a Sioux war-whoop with its back
broken, that he stopped to see what it
was all about. There stood a butcher
who had exposed for sale seven small
stuck pigs, all one litter; and if they
had been his own children, and died
heretics, he could not have howled over
them in a more heart-rending manner.</p>

<p>About sunrise, and even before it,&mdash;for
the Romans are early risers,&mdash;you
will hear in spring-time a sharp ringing
voice under your window, '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Acqua chetosa!
Acqua, chetosa!</span>' an abridgment
of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">acque accetosa</span>, or water from the
fountain of Accetosa, considered a good
aperient, and which is drank before
breakfast. Also a voice crying out,

'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Acqua-vi-ta!</span>' or spirits, drank by the
workmen and others at an expense of
a baioccho or two the table-spoonful,
for that is all the small glasses hold.
In the early morning, too, you hear the
chattering jackdaws on the roofs; and
then, more distinctly than later in the
day, the clocks striking their odd way.
The Roman clocks ring from one to six
strokes four times during the twenty-four
hours, and not from one to twelve strokes,
as with us. Sunset is twenty-four o'clock,
and is noted by six strokes; an hour after
sunset is one o'clock, and is noted by
one stroke; and so on until six hours
after, when it begins striking one again.
As the quarter hours are also rung by
the clocks, if you happen to be near one
you will have a fine chance to get in a
muddle trying to separate quarters from
hours, and Roman time from your own.
Another noise comes from the game
of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">morra</span>. Caper was looking out of his
window one morning, pipe in mouth,
when he saw two men suddenly face
each other, one of them bringing his
arm down very quickly, when the other
yelled as if kicked, '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Du!</span>' (two), and
the first shouted at the top of his lungs,
'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Tre!</span>' (three). Then they both went
at it, pumping their hands up and down
and spreading their fingers with a quickness
which was astonishing, while all
the time they kept screaming, 'One!'
'Four!' 'Three!' 'Two!' 'Five!' etc.,
etc. 'Ha!' said Caper, 'this is something
like; 'tis an arithmetical, mathematical,
etcetrical school in the open air.
The dirtiest one is very quick; he will
learn to count five in no time. But I
don't see the necessity of saying "three"
when the other brings down four fingers,
or saying "five" when he shows two.
But I suppose it is all right; he hasn't
learned to give the right names yet.'

He learned later that they were gambling.</p>

<p>While these men were shouting, there
came along an ugly old woman with a
tambourine and a one-legged man with
a guitar, and seeing prey in the shape
of Caper at his window, they pounced
on him, as it were, and poured forth the
most ear-rending discord; the old lady
singing, the old gentleman backing up
against a wall and scratching at an accompaniment
on a jangling old guitar.
The old lady had a bandana handkerchief
tied over her head, and whilst she
watched Caper she cast glances up and
down the street, to see if some rich stranger,
or <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">milordo</span>, was not coming to throw
her a piece of silver.</p>

<p>'What are you howling about?' shouted
Caper down to her.</p>

<p>'A new Neapolitan canzonetta, signore;
all about a young man who grieves
for his sweetheart, because he thinks
she is not true to him, and what he says
to her in a serenade.' And here she
screechingly sung,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">But do not rage, I beg, my dear;</p>
<p class="l">I want you for my wife,</p>
<p class="l">And morning, noon, and night likewise,</p>
<p class="l">I'll love you like my life.</p>
</div>

<p>CHORUS.</p>

<div class="lg">

<p class="l">I only want to get a word,</p>
<p class="l">My charming girl, from thee.</p>
<p class="l">You know, Ninella, I can't breathe,</p>
<p class="l">Unless your heart's for me!</p>
</div>

<p>'Well,' said Caper, 'if this is Italian
music, I don't <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">see</span> it.'</p>

<p>The one-legged old gentleman clawed
away at the strings of the guitar.</p>

<p>'I say,'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">llustrissimo</span>,' shouted Caper

down to him, 'what kind of strings are
those on your instrument?'</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Excellenza</span>, catgut,' he shouted, in
answer.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Benissimo!</span> I prefer cats in the original
packages. There's a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">paolo</span>: travel!'</p>

<p>Caper had the misfortune to make the
acquaintance of a professor of the mandolin,
a wire-strung instrument, resembling
a long-necked squash cut in two,
to be played on with a quill, and which,
with a guitar and violin, makes a concert
that thrills you to the bones and
cuts the nerves away.</p>

<p>But the crowning glory of all that is
ear-rending and peace-destroying, is
carried around by the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Pifferari</span> about
Christmas time. It is a hog-skin, filled
with wind, having pipes at one end, and
a jackass at the other, and is known in
some lands as the bagpipe. The small
shrines to the Virgin, particularly those
in the streets where the wealthy English
reside, are played upon assiduously by
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">pifferari</span>, who are supposed by romantic
travelers to come from the far-away
Abbruzzi Mountains, and make a
pilgrimage to the Eternal City to fulfil a
vow to certain saints; whereas it is sundry
cents they are really after. They are for
the most part artists' models, who at this
season of the year get themselves up <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">
la pifferari</span>, or piper, to prey on the romantic
susceptibilities and pockets of
the strangers in Rome, and, with a pair
of long-haired goat-skin breeches, a
sheepskin coat, brown rags, and sandals,
or <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">cioccie</span>, with a shocking bad conical
black or brown hat, in which are
stuck peacock's or cock's feathers, they
are ready equipped to attack the shrines
and the strangers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Caper there was a
shrine to the Virgin in the second-story
front of the house next to where he
lived; that is, unfortunately for his musical
ear, for the lamp that burned in
front of the shrine every dark night was
a shining and pious light to guide him
home, and thus, ordinarily, a very fortunate
arrangement. In the third-story
front room of the house of the shrine
dwelt a Scotch artist named MacGuilp,
who was a grand amateur of these
pipes, and who declared that no sound in
the world was so sweet to his ear as the
bagpipes: they recalled the heather,
haggis, and the Lothians, and the mountain
dew, ye ken, and all those sorts of
things.</p>

<p>One morning at breakfast in the Caf
Greco he discoursed at length about the
pleasure the pifferari gave him; while
Caper, taking an opposite view, said
they had, during the last few days,
driven him nearly crazy, and he wished
the squealing hog-skins well out of town.</p>

<p>MacGuilp told him he had a poor ear
for music: that there was a charm about
the bagpipes unequalled even by the
unique voices of the Sistine Chapel;
and there was nothing he would like
better than to have all the pipers of
Rome under his windows.</p>

<p>Caper remembered this last rash
speech of Master MacGuilp, and determined
at an early hour to test its truth.
It happened, the very next morning at
breakfast, that MacGuilp, in a triumphant
manner, told him that he had received
a promise of a visit from the Duchess
of &mdash;&mdash;, with several other titled
English; and said he had not a doubt of
selling several paintings to them. MacGuilp's
style was of the blood-and-thunder
school: red dawns, murdered kings,
blood-stained heather, and Scotch plaids,
the very kind that should be shown to
the sweet strainings of hog-skin bagpipes.</p>

<p>In conversation Caper found out the
hour at which the duchess intended to
make her visit. He made his preparations
accordingly. Accompanied by
Rocjean, he visited Gigi, who kept a costume
and life school of models, found out
where the pipers drank most wine, and
going there and up the Via Fratina and
down the Spanish Steps, managed to
find them, and arranged it so that at
the time the duchess was viewing MacGuilp's
paintings, he should have the
full benefit of a serenade from all the
pifferari in Rome.</p>

<p>The next morning Caper, pipe in
mouth, at his window, saw the carriage

of the duchess drive up, and from it the
noble English dismount and ascend to
the artist's studio. The carriage had
hardly driven away when up came two
of the pipers, and happening to cast
their eyes up they saw Caper, who
hailed them and told them not to begin
playing until the others arrived. In a
few moments six of the hog-skin squeezers
stood ready to begin their infernal
squawking.</p>

<p>'Go ahead!' shouted Caper, throwing
a handful of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">baiocchi</span> among them; and
as soon as these were gathered up, the
pipers gave one awful, heart-chilling
blast, and the concert was fairly commenced.
Squealing, shrieking, grunting,
yelling, and humming, the sounds
rose higher and higher. Open flew the
windows in every direction.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">C'est foudroyante!</span>' said the pretty
French <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">modiste</span>.</p>

<p>'What the devil's broke loose?'
shouted an American.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Mein Gott im himmel! was ist das?</span>'
roared the German baron.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Casaccio! cosa faceste?</span>' shrieked
the lovely Countess Grimanny.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">In nomine Domine!</span>' groaned a fat
friar.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Caramba! vayase al infierno!</span>'
screamed Don Santiago Gomez.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Bassama teremtete!</span>' swore the Hungarian
gentleman.</p>

<p>Louder squealed the bagpipes, their
buzz filled the air, their shrieks went
ringing up to MacGuilp like the cries of
Dante's condemned. The duchess found
the sound barbarous. MacGuilp opened
his window, upon which the pipers
strained their lungs for the Signore Inglese,
grand amateur of the bagpipes.
He begged them to go away. 'No, no,
signore; we know you love our music;
we won't go away.'</p>

<p>The duchess could stand it no longer,
her Servant called the carriage, the English
got in and drove off.</p>

<p>Still rung out the sounds of the six
bagpipes. Caper threw them more <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">baiocchi</span>.</p>

<p>Suddenly MacGuilp burst out of the
door of his house, maul-stick in hand,
rushing on the pifferari to put them to
flight.</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Iddio giusto!</span>' shouted two of the pipers;
'it is, IT IS the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Cacciatore</span>! the
hunter; the Great Hunter!'</p>

<p>'He is a painter!' shouted another.</p>

<p>'No, he isn't; he's a hunter. <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Gran
Cacciatore!</span> Doesn't he spend all his
time after quails and snipe and woodcock?
Haven't I been out with him
day after day at Ostia? Long live the
great hunter!'</p>

<p>MacGuilp was touched in a tender
spot. The homage paid him as a great
hunter more than did away with his anger
at the bagpipe serenade. And the
last Caper saw of him he was leading six
pifferari into a wine shop, where they
would not come out until seven of them
were unable to tell the music of bagpipes
from the music of the spheres.</p>

<p>So ends the music, noises, and voices,
of the seven-hilled city.</p>

<h3>Sermons In Stones.</h3>

<p>One bright Sunday morning in January,
Rocjean called on Caper to ask him
to improve the day by taking a walk.</p>

<p>'I thought of going up to the English
chapel outside the Popolo to see a pretty
New Yorkeress,' said the latter; 'but
the affair is not very pressing, and I believe
a turn round the Villa Borghese
would do me as much good as only looking
at a pretty girl and half hearing a
poor sermon.'</p>

<p>'As for a sermon, we need not miss
that,' answered Rocjean, 'for we will
stop in at Chapin the sculptor's studio,
and if we escape one, and he there, I
am mistaken. They call his studio a
shop, and they call his shop the Orphan's
Asylum, because he manufactured
an Orphan Girl some years ago,
and, as it sold well, he has kept on making
orphans ever since.</p>

<p>'The murderer!'</p>

<p>'Yes; but not half as atrocious as the
reality. You must know that when he
first came over here he had an order to
make a small Virgin Mary for a Catholic
church in Boston; but the order being
countermanded after he had commenced

modeling in clay, he was determined
not to lose his time, and so, having
somewhere read of, in a yellow-covered
novel, or seen in some fashion-plate
magazine, a doleful-looking female called
The Orphan, he instantly determined,
cruel executioner that he is, to also
make an orphan. And he did. There
is a dash of bogus sentiment in it that
passes for coin current with many of our
traveling Americans; and the thing has
"sold." He told me not long since he
had orders for twelve copies of different
sized Orphans, and you will see them all
through his asylum. Do you remember
those lines in Richard the Third,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'"Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</p>

<p class="l">And call us orphans&mdash;wretched?"'</p>
</div>

<p>They found Chapin in his shop, alias
studio, busily looking over a number of
plaster casts of legs and arms. He
arose quickly as they entered and threw
a cloth over the casts.</p>

<p>'Hah! gudmornin', Mister Caper.
Glad to see you in my studiyo. Hallo,
Rocjan! you there? Why haven't you
ben up to see my wife and daughters?
She feels hurt, I tell you, 'cause you
don't come near us. Do you know that
Burkings of Bosting was round here to
my studiyo yeserday: sold <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">him</span> an Orphan.
By the way, Mister Caper, air
you any relation to Caper of the great
East Ingy house of Caper?'</p>

<p>'He is an uncle of mine, and is now
in Florence; he will be in Rome next
week.'</p>

<p>A tender glow of interest beamed in
Chapin's eyes: in imagination he saw
another Orphan sold to the rich Caper,
who might 'influence trade.' His tone
of voice after this was subdued. As
Caper happened to brush against some
plaster coming in the studio, Chapin
hastened to brush it from his coat, and
he did it as if it were the down on the
wing of a beautiful golden butterfly.</p>

<p>'I was goin' to church this mornin'
long with Missus Chapin; but I guess
I'll stay away for once in me life. I
want to show you The Orphan.'</p>

<p>'I beg that you will not let me interfere
with any engagement you may
have,' said Caper; 'I can call as well at
any other time.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no; I won't lissen to that; I don't
want to git to meeting before sermon, so
come right stret in here now. There!
there's The Orphan. You see I've made
her accordin' to the profoundest rules of
art. You may take a string or a yard
measure and go all over her, you won't
find her out of the way a fraction. The
figure is six times the length of the foot;
this was the way Phidias worked, and I
agree with him. Them were splendid
old fellows, them Greeks. There was
art for you; high art!'</p>

<p>'That in the Acropolis was of the
highest order,' said Rocjean.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Chapin, who did not
know where it was; 'far above all other.
There was some sentiment in them
days; but it was all of the religious
stripe; they didn't come down to domestic
life and feelin'; they hadn't
made the strides we have towards layin'
open art to the million&mdash;towards developing
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">hum</span> feelings. They worked for
a precious few; but we do it up for the
many. Now there's the A-poller Belvidiary&mdash;beautiful
thing; but the idea of
brushin' his hair that way is ridicoolus.
Did you ever see anybody with their
hair fixed that way? Never! They
had a way among the Greeks of fixing
their drapery right well; but I've invented
a plan&mdash;for which I've applied
to Washington for a patent&mdash;that I
think will beat anything Phidias ever
did.'</p>

<p>'You can't tell how charmed I am to
hear you,' spoke Rocjean.</p>

<p>'Well, it <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a great invention,' continued
Chapin; 'and as I know neither of
you ain't in the 'trade' (smiling), I
don't care but what I'll show it to you,
if you'll promise, honor bright, you won't
tell anybody. You see I take a piece
of muslin and hang it onto a statue the
way I want the folds to fall; then I take
a syringe filled with starch and glue and
go all over it, so that when it dries it'll
be as hard as a rock. Then I go all
over it with a certain oily preparation

and lastly I run liquid plaster-paris in
it, and when it hardens, I have an exact
mold of the drapery. There! But I
hain't explained The Orphan. You see
she's sittin' on a very light chair&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span>

shows the very little support she has in
this world. The hand to the head shows
meditation; and the Bible on her knee
shows devotion; you see it's open to the
book, chapter, and verse which refers to
the young ravens.'</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said Caper, 'but may I
ask why she has such a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">very</span> low-necked
dress on?'</p>

<p>'Well, my model has got such a fine
neck and shoulders,' replied Chapin,
'that I re-eely couldn't help showing 'em
off on the Orphan: besides, they're
more in demand&mdash;the low neck and
short sleeves&mdash;than the high-bodied
style, which has no buyers. But there
is a work I'm engaged on now that
would just soot your uncle. Mr. Caper,
come this way.'</p>

<p>Caper saw what he supposed was
a safe to keep meat cool in, and approached.
Chapin threw back the doors
of it like a showman about to disclose
the What Is It? and Caper saw a dropsical-looking
Cupid with a very short
shirt on, and a pair of winged shoes on
his feet. The figure was starting forward
as if to catch his equilibrium,
which he had that moment lost, and was
only prevented from tumbling forward
by a bag held behind him in his left
hand, while his right arm and hand, at
full length, pointed a sharp arrow in
front of him.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me what <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span> figger
represents?' asked Chapin. As he received
no reply, he continued: '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">That</span> is
Enterprise; the two little ruts at his
feet represent a railroad; the arrow,
showin' he's sharp, points ahead; Go
ahead! is his motto; the bag in his hand
represents money, which the keen, sharp,
shrewd business man knows is the reward
of enterprise. The wreath round his
head is laurel mixed up with lightnin',
showin' he's up to the tellygraph; the
pen behind his ear shows he can figger;
and his short shirt shows economy, that
admirable virtoo. The wings on his
shoes air taken from Mercury, as I suppose
you know; and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I say, now, Chapin, don't you think
he's got a little too much legs, and
rather extra stomach on him, to make
fast time?' asked Rocjean.</p>

<p>'Measure him, measure him!' said
Chapin, indignantly; 'there's a string.
Figure six times the length of his foot,
everything else in proportion. No, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">sir</span>;
I have not studied the classic for nothin';
if there is any one thing I am strong
on, it's anatomy. Only look at his hair.
Why, sir, I spent three weeks once dissectin';
and for more'n six months I
didn't do anything, during my idle time,
but dror figgers. Art is a kind of thing
that's born in a man. This saying the
ancients were better sculpters than we
air, is no such thing; what did they
know about steam-engines or telegraphs?

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Fiddle!</span> They did some fustrate things,
but they had no idee of fixin' hair as it
should be fixed. No, sir; we moderns
have great add-vantagiz, and we improve
'em. Rome is the Cra&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I must bid you good-day,' interrupted
Caper; 'your wife will miss you at the
sermon: you will attribute it to me; and
I would not intentionally be the cause
of having her ill-will for anything.'</p>

<p>'Well, she is a pretty hard innimy;
and they do talk here in Rome if you
don't toe the mark. But ree-ly, you
mustn't go off mad (smiling). You must
call up with Rocjan and see us; and I
ree-ly hope that when your uncle comes
you will bring him to my studiyo. I am
sure my Enterprise will soot him.'</p>

<p>So Chapin saw them out of his studio.
Not until Caper found himself seated on
a stone bench under the ilexes of the
Villa Borghese, watching the sunbeams
darting on the little lizards, and seeing
far off the Albanian Mountains, snowcapped
against the blue sky&mdash;not until
then did he breathe freely.</p>

<p>'Rocjean,' said he; 'that stone-cutter
down there&mdash;that Chapin&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Chameau!</span> roared Rocjean. 'He
and his kind are doing for art what the
Jews did for prize-fighting&mdash;they ruin

it. They make art the laughing-stock
of all refined and educated people. Art
applied solely to sculpture and painting
is dead; it will not rise again in these
our times. But art, the fairy-fingered
beautifier of all that surrounds our
homes and daily walks, save paintings
and statuary, never breathed so fully,
clearly, nobly as now, and her pathway
amid the lowly and homely things
around us is shedding beauty wherever
it goes. The rough-handed artisan who,
slowly dreaming of the beautiful, at last
turns out a stone that will beautify and
adorn a room, instead of rendering it
hideous, has done for this practical generation
what he of an earlier theoretical
age did for his cotemporaries when he
carved the imperial Venus of Milos.
Enough; <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">this</span> is the sermon <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> preached
from stones.'</p>

<a name="toc_13"></a>
<h3>A Ball At The Costa Palace</h3>

<p>One sunlight morning in February,
while hard at work in his studio, Caper
was agreeably surprised by the entrance
of an elderly uncle of his, Mr. Bill
Browne, of St. Louis, a gentleman of
the rosy, stout, hearty school of old
bachelors, who, having made a large
fortune by keeping a Western country
store, prudently retired from business,
and finding it dull work doing nothing,
wisely determined to enjoy himself with
a tour over the Continent, 'or any other
place he might conclude to visit.'</p>

<p>'I say, Jim, did you expect to see me
here?' was his first greeting.</p>

<p>'Why, Uncle Bill! Well, you are the
last man I ever thought would turn up.
They didn't write me a word of your
coming over,' answered Caper.</p>

<p>'Mistake; they wrote you all about
it; and if you'll drop round at the post-office,
you'll find letters there telling you
the particulars. Fact is, I am ahead of
the mail. Coming over in the steamer,
met a man named Orville; told me he
knew you, that he was coming straight
through to Rome, and offered to pilot
me. So I gave up Paris and all that,
and came smack through, eighteen days
from New York. But I'm dry. Got
a match? Here, try one of these cigars.'</p>

<p>Caper took a cigar from his uncle's
case, lit it, and then, calling the man who
swept out the studios, sent him to the
neighboring wine-shop for a bottle of
wine.</p>

<p>'By George, Jim, that's a pretty
painting: that jackass is fairly alive,
and so's the girl with a red boddice. I
say, what's she got that towel on her
head for? Is it put there to dry?'</p>

<p>'No; that's an Italian peasant girl's
head-covering. Most all of them do so.'</p>

<p>'Do they? I'm glad of that. But
here comes your man with the liquor.'</p>

<p>And, after drinking two or three tumblers
full, Uncle Bill decided that it was
pretty good cider. The wine finished,
together with a couple of rolls that came
with it, the two sallied out for a walk
around the Pincian Hill, the grand
promenade of Rome. Towards sunset
they thought of dinner, and Uncle Bill,
anxious to see life, accepted Caper's invitation
to dine at the old Gabioni: here
they ordered the best dishes, and the
former swore it was as good a dinner
as he ever got at the Planter's House.
Rocjean, who dined there, delighted the
old gentleman immensely, and the two
fraternized at once, and drank each
other's health, old style, until Caper,
fearing that neither could conveniently
hold more, suggested an adjournment to
the Greco for coffee and cigars.</p>

<p>While they were in the caf, Rocjean
quietly proposed something to Caper,
who at once assented; the latter then
said to Uncle Bill,&mdash;</p>

<p>'You have arrived in Rome just at
the right time. You may have heard at
home of the great Giacinti family; well,
the Prince Nicolo di Giacinti gives a
grand ball to-night at the Palazzo Costa.
Rocjean and I have received invitations,
embracing any illustrious strangers
of our acquaintance who may happen to
be in Rome; so you must go with us.
You have no idea, until you come to
know them intimately, what a good-natured,
off-hand set the best of the Roman
nobility are. Compelled by circumstances

to keep up for effect an appearance
of great reserve and dignity before the
public, they indemnify themselves for it
in private by having the highest kind
of old times. They are passionately attached
to their native habits and costumes,
and though driven, on state occasions
especially, to imitate French and
English habits, yet they love nothing
better than at times to enjoy themselves
in their native way. The ball given
by the prince to-night is what might be
called a free-and-easy. It is his particular
desire that no one should come in
full dress; in fact, he rather likes to
have his stranger guests come in their
worst clothes, for this prevents the attention
of the public being called to
them as they enter the palace. After
you have lived some time in Rome you
will see how necessary it is to keep dark,
so you will see no flaring light at the
palace gate; it's all as quiet and common-place
as possible. The dresses, you
must remember, are assumed for the occasion
because they are, or were, the national
costume, which is fast disappearing,
and if it were not for the noble
wearers you will see to-night, you could
not find them anywhere in Rome. You
will perhaps think the nobility at the
ball hardly realize your ideas of Italian
beauty and refinement, compared with
the fine specimens of men and women
you may have seen among the Italian
opera singers at home: well, these same
singers are picked specimens, and are
chosen for their height and muscular
development from the whole nation, so
that strangers may think all the rest at
home are like them: it is a little piece
of deception we can pardon.'</p>

<p>After this long prelude, Rocjean proposed
that they should try a game of
billiards in the Caf Nuovo. After they
had played a game or two, and drank
several <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">mezzo caldos</span>, or rum punches,
they walked up the Corso to the Via
San Claudio, No. 48, and entered the
palace gate. It was very dark after
they entered, so Rocjean, telling them to
wait one moment, lit a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">cerina</span>, or piece
of waxed cord, an article indispensable
to a Roman, and, crossing the broad
courtyard, they entered a small door, and
after climbing and twisting and turning,
found a ticket-taker, and the next minute
were in the ball-room.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill was delighted with the
excessively free-and-easy ball of Prince
Giacinti, but was very anxious to know
the names of the nobility, and Rocjean
politely undertook to point out the
celebrities, offering kindly to introduce
him to any one he might think looked
sympathetic; 'what they call <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">simpatico</span>
in Italian,' explained Rocjean.</p>

<p>'That pretty girl in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Ciociara</span> costume
is the Condessa or Countess Stella di
Napoli.'</p>

<p>'Introduce me,' said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Rocjean went through the performance,
concluding thus: 'The countess
expresses a wish that you should order
a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">bottiglia</span> (about two bottles) of red
wine.'</p>

<p>'Go ahead,' quoth Uncle Bill; 'for a
nobility ball this comes as near a
dance-house affair as I ever want
to approach. By the way, who is that
pickpocket-looking genius with eyes
like a black snake?'</p>

<p>'Who is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span>?' said Rocjean,
theatrically. 'Chut! a word in your ear; that
is An-to-nel-li!'</p>

<p>'The devil! But I heard some one
only a few minutes ago call him
Angelucio.'</p>

<p>'That was done satirically, for it
means big angel, which you, who read
the papers, know that Antonelli is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">not</span>.
But here comes the wine, and I see the
countess looks dry. Pour out a
half-dozen glasses for her. The
Roman women, high and low, paddle in wine like
ducks, and it never upsets them; for,
like ducks, their feet are so large that
neither you nor wine can throw them.
I wish you could speak Italian, for here
comes the Princess Giacinta <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">con Marchese</span>&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I wish,' said Uncle Bill, 'you would
talk English.'</p>

<p>'Well,' continued Rocjean, 'with the
Marchioness Nina Romana, if you like
that better. Shall I introduce you?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' replied the old gentleman,

'and order two more what d'ye
call 'ems. It's cheap&mdash;this knowing a
princess for a quart of red teaberry
tooth-wash, for that's what this "wine"
amounts to. I am going to dance to-night,
for the Princess Giacinta is a
complete woman after my heart, and
weighs her two hundred pound any
day.'</p>

<p>The nobility now began begging Rocjean
and Caper to introduce them to his
excellency <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Il vecchio</span>, or the old man;
and Uncle Bill, in his enthusiasm at finding
himself surrounded with so many
princes, Allegrini, Pelligrini, Sapgrini,
and Dungreeny, compelled Caper to order
up a barrel of wine, set it a-tap, and
tell the nobility to 'go in.' It is needless
to say that they <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">went</span> in. Many of the
costumes were very rich, especially those
of the female nobility; and in the rush
for a glass of wine the effect of the brilliant
draperies flying here and there,
struggling and pushing, was notable.
The musicians, who were standing on
what appeared to be barrels draped with
white cloth, jumped down and tried their
luck at the wine-cask, and, after satisfying
their thirst, returned to their duties.
There was a guitar, mandolin, violin,
and flute, and the music was good for
dancing. Uncle Bill was pounced on
by the Princess Giacinta and whirled off
into some kind of a dance, he did not
know what; round flew the room and
the nobility; round flew barrels of teaberry
tooth-wash, beautiful princesses,
big devils of Antonellis. Lights, flash,
hum, buzz, buzz, zzz&mdash;ooo&mdash;zoom!</p>

<p>Uncle Bill opened his eyes as the sunlight
shed one golden bar into his sleeping-room
at the Hotel d'Europe, and
there by his bedside sat his nephew, Jim
Caper, reading a letter, while on a table
near at hand was a goblet full of ice,
a bottle of hock, and another bottle
corked, with string over it.</p>

<p>'It's so-da wa-ter,' said Uncle Bill,
musing aloud.</p>

<p>'Hallo, uncle, you awake?' asked
Caper, suddenly raising his eyes from
his letter.</p>

<p>'I am, my son. Give thy aged father
thy blessing, and open that hock and
soda water quicker! I say, Jim, now,
what became of the nobility, the Colonnas
and Aldobrandinis, after they finished
that barrel? Strikes me some of
them will have an owlly appearance this
morning.'</p>

<p>'You don't know them,' answered Caper.</p>

<p>'I am beginning to believe I don't,
too,' spoke Uncle Bill. 'I say, now, Jim,
where did we go last night?'</p>

<p>'Why, Uncle Bill, to tell you the
plain truth, we went to a ball at the
Costa Palace, and a model ball it was,
too.'</p>

<p>'I have you! Models who sit for you
painters. Well, if they arn't nobility,
they drink like kings, so it's all right.
Give us the hock, and say no more about
it.'</p>

<h2>Howe's Cave.</h2>


<p>Few persons, perhaps, are aware that
Schoharie County, N.Y., contains a cave
said to be nine or ten miles in extent,
and, in many respects, one of the most
remarkable in America. Its visitors are
few,&mdash;owing, probably, to its recent discovery,
together with its comparative
inaccessibility;&mdash;yet these few are well
rewarded for its exploration.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1861, I
started, with three companions, to visit
this interesting place.</p>

<p>I will not weary the reader by describing
the beauty of the Hudson and
the grandeur of the Catskills; yet I
would fain fix in my memory forever
one sunrise, seen from the summit of a
bluff on the eastern bank of the river,

when the fog, gradually lifting itself
from the stream, and slowly breaking
into misty fragments, unveiled broad,
smiling meadows, dark forests, village
after village, while above all, far in the
distance, rose the Catskills, clear in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>After two days crowded with enjoyment,
we arrived in Schoharie, where
we passed the night. Having given
orders to be called at five, we took
advantage of the leisure hour this arrangement
gave us to view, the next
morning.</p>

<div>
<a name="toc_15"></a>
<h3>An Old Fort.</h3>

<p>In reality, the 'fort' is a dilapidated
old church, used as a shelter during the
Indian wars, and also in the days of
the Revolution. On the smooth stones
that form the eastern side are carved
the names of the soldiers who defended
it, with the date, and designation of
the regiment to which they belonged.
I deciphered also, among other curious
details, the name of the person who

'gave the favor of the ground.' I would
gladly have indulged my antiquarian
tastes by copying these rude inscriptions;
but the eager cries of my companions
compelled me to hurry on.</p>

<p>The western portion of the structure
has also its story to tell. The traces
of besieging cannon balls are still to be
distinctly seen, and in one place I observed
a smooth, round hole, made by
the passage of a ball into the interior
of the fort.</p>

<p>As I stood on the walls of this ancient
building, surveying the valley it overlooked,
with its straggling village lying
at our feet, and the fair Schoharie
Creek, now gleaming in the sunlight of
the meadows, or darkening in the shade
of the trees that overhung it, the past
and the present mingled strongly in my
thoughts.</p>

<p>The Stars and Stripes, that on this
very spot had seen our fathers repelling
a foreign foe, now waved over their
sons, forced from their quiet homes, not
to contend with the stranger and the
alien, but to subdue those rebellious
brothers whose sacrilegious hands had
torn down that sacred flag, reared
amidst the trials and perils of '76.
Not less noble the present contest than
the past, nor less heroic the soldier of
to-day than the patriot of the Revolution.
We continue to-day the fight
they fought against injustice and oppression&mdash;a
conflict that will end only
when every nation and every race shall
lift unshackled hands up to God in
thanksgiving for the gift of freedom.
A deeper love of my country, and a
firmer trust in the God of truth and
justice, sank into my heart as I turned
away from those rude walls, sacred to
the memory of departed valor.</p>

<p>We hurried back to the breakfast
that awaited us, and then drove to</p>

</div>

<hr class="page">

<div>
<a name="toc_16"></a>
<h3>The Cave</h3>

<p>which lies six miles from the village of
Schoharie. The entrance is at the base
of a heavily-wooded mountain that shuts
in a secluded little valley. The only
opening from this solitary vale is made
by a small stream that winds out from
among the hills. The entire seclusion
of the place has prevented its earlier
discovery; but the inevitable 'Hotel'
now rears its wooden walls above the
cave to encourage future adventurers
to explore its recesses.</p>

<p>In the absence of the proprietor of
the hotel, who usually acts as cicerone,
we took as guide a sun-burnt young
man, with an economical portion of
nose, closely cut hair, and a wiry little
mouth, which we saw at a glance would
open only at the rate of a quarter of
a dollar a fact. He proved himself,
however, shrewd, witty, and, withal,
good-natured, and as fond of a joke as
any one of us all. Bob, for so our new
companion named himself, showed us at
once into a dressing-room, advising us
to put on, over our own garments, certain
exceedingly coarse and ragged coats,
hats and pants, which transformed us
at once from rather fashionable young
men into a set of forlorn-looking beggars.
Each laughed at the appearance
of the other, unconscious of his own

transformation; but Bob, with more
truth than politeness, informed us that
we all 'looked like the Old Nick;'

whence it appeared that in Bob's opinion
the Enemy is usually sorely afflicted
with a shabby wardrobe, and that, in
the words of the sage,</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Poverty is the devil.'</p>
</div>


<p>Being furnished with small oil lamps,
we descended to the mouth of the cave.
This opens at once into an entrance-hall,
one hundred and fifty feet in
length and thirty in width, and high
enough for a tall man to enter upright.</p>

<p>I inquired of Bob when the cave
was discovered. 'In 1842,' he replied.

'And by whom?' I continued. 'Why,'
rejoined our guide, 'Mister Howe was
a huntin' for caves, and he came across
this one.' Rather a queer thing to be
hunting for, I thought, though without
comment; but in future I allowed Bob
to carry on the conversation as best
suited himself. He plunged at once
into a dissertation on the state of the
country, gravely stating that 'Washington
was taken.' At the involuntary
smile which this astounding piece of
news called forth, Bob confessed 'he
might be mistaken in this respect, as
his paper came but once a week, and
frequently only once in two weeks.'
Finding him a stanch Union man, and
inclined to serve his country to the
best of his ability, we undertook 'to
post him up' on the present state of
affairs, for which the poor fellow was
truly grateful.</p>

<p>Entrance Hall leads into Washington
Hall, a magnificent apartment, three
hundred feet long, and in the lowest
part upwards of forty feet high. Our
guide favored us at every turn with
some new story or legend, repeated in
a sing-song, nasal tone, ludicrously contrasting
with the extravagance of the
tales themselves. Yet he recited all
alike with the most immovable gravity.
It was a lively waltz of three notes.</p>

<p>Old Tunnel and Giant's Chapel, two
fine cave-rooms, were next explored.
On entering the latter, Bob favored us
with the rehearsal of an old story from
the Arabian Nights, which&mdash;unfortunately,
not one which will bear repetition&mdash;he
wished us to believe actually
happened in this very locality.</p>

<p>I may here confess that, when we
came to 'the dark hole in the ground,'
I felt some slight reluctance to trust myself
therein. Bob, observing this, immediately
drew from his lively imagination
such an astonishing increase of the perils
of the way, looking complacently at
me all the while, that my alarm, strange
to say, took flight at once, and I pushed
onward defiantly. The journey is, however,
one that might justly inspire timidity.
Above our heads, and on each side,
frowned immense rocks, threatening at
every instant to fall upon us; while
the dash and babble of a stream whose
course we followed, increasing in volume
as we progressed, came to our ears
like the 'sound of many waters.' We
crossed this stream a hundred times, at
least, in our journey. Sometimes it
murmured and fretted in a chasm far
below us; again, it spread itself out in
our very path, or danced merrily at our
side, until it seemed to plunge into some
distant abyss with the roar of a cataract.</p>

<p>We emerged from the windings of
our tortuous path into Harlem Tunnel,
a room six hundred feet in length. In
its sides were frequent openings, leading
into hitherto unexplored parts of
the cave; but we did not venture to
enter many of these. Never have I
seen such rocks as we here encountered;
at one time piled up on one
another, ready to totter and fall at a
touch; at another, jutting out in immense
boulders, sixty feet above our
heads, while, in the openings they left,
we gazed upward into darkness that
seemed immeasurable.</p>

<p>From Harlem Tunnel we came into
Cataract Hall, also of great length, and
remarkable for containing a small opening
extending to an unknown distance
within the mountain, since it apparently
cannot be explored. Applying the ear
to this opening, the sound of an immense
cataract becomes audible, pouring over

the rocks far within the recesses of the
mountain, where the Creator alone, who
meted out those unseen, sunless waters,
can behold its beauty and its terror.</p>

<p>Crossing the Pool of Siloam, whose
babbling waters sparkled into beauty
as we held our lamps above them, we
entered Franklin Hall. Here the roof,
although high enough in some places,
is uncomfortably low in others; whereupon
Bob bade us give heed to the caution
of Franklin, 'Stoop as you go, and
you will miss many hard thumps.'</p>

<p>We arrived next at Flood Hall, where
a party of explorers were once put in
great peril by a sudden freshet in the
stream. They barely saved themselves
by rapid flight, the water becoming
waist-deep before they gained the entrance.
We had no reason to doubt
the truth of this story, as there were
evidences of the rise and fall of water
all about us.</p>

<p>Congress Hall now awaited us, but I
will omit a description of it, as Musical
Hall, which immediately succeeded, contains
so much more that is interesting.
On entering, our attention was first directed
to an aperture wide enough for
the admission of a man's head. Any
sound made in this opening is taken up
and repeated by echo after echo, till the
very spirit of music seems awakened.
Wave after wave of melodious sound
charms the ear, even if the first awakening
note has been most discordant. If
the soul is filled with silent awe while
listening to the unseen waterfall in Cataract
Hall, it is here wooed into peace
by a harmony more perfect than any
produced by mortal invention. A temple-cavern
vaster than Ellora with a
giant 'lithophone' for organ!</p>

<p>The second wonder of Musical Hall is
a lake of great extent, and from ten to
thirty feet in depth. The smooth surface
of these crystal waters, never ruffled
by any air of heaven, and undisturbed
save by the dip of our oars as we
were ferried across, the utter darkness
that hid the opposite shore from our
straining sight, the huge rocks above,
whose clustering stalactites, lighted by
our glimmering lamps, sparkled like a
starry sky, the sound of the far-off waterfall,
softened by distance into a sad
and solemn music, all united to recall
with a vivid power, never before felt, the
passage of the 'pious neas' over the
Styx, which I had so often read with delight
in my boyhood. I half fancied our
Yankee Bob fading into a vision of the
classic Charon, and that the ghosts of
unhappy spirits were peering at us from
the darkness.</p>

<p>At the end of the lake is Annexation
Rock, a huge limestone formation in
the shape of an egg. It stands on one
end, is twenty-eight feet in diameter,
and over forty in height.</p>

<p>We were now introduced into Fat
Man's Misery, where the small and attenuated
have greatly the advantage.
We emerged from this narrow and difficult
passage into the Museum, half a
mile long, and so called from the number
and variety of its formations. We
did not linger to examine its curiosities,
but pushed on over the Alps, which
we surmounted, aided partly by ladders.
Very steep and rugged were these Alps,
and quite worthy of the name they bear.
We descended from them into the Bath-room,
where a pool of water and sundry
other arrangements suggest to a lively
imagination its designation. It certainly
has the recommendation of being the
most retired bath-room ever known.
That of the Neapolitan sibyl is public
in comparison to it.</p>

<p>We then entered Pirate's Retreat.
Why so named, I can not guess, for I
doubt if the boldest pirate who ever
sailed the 'South Seas o'er' would dare
venture alone so far underground as we
now found ourselves.</p>

<p>Leaving the Pirate's Retreat, we were
obliged to cross the Rocky Mountains,
similar in formation and arrangement to
the Alps. The Rocky Mountains lead
into Jehoshaphat's Valley, one mile in
length. Like its namesake, this valley
is a deep ravine, with steep, rugged
sides, and a brawling brook running at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Miller's Hall next claims our attention.

Here we take leave of the brook,
which, with the cave, loses itself in a
measureless ravine, where the rocks
have fallen in such a manner as to obstruct
any further explorations.</p>

<p>From thence, turning to the right, we
enter Winding Way, a most appropriate
name for the place. The narrow
passage turns and twists between masses
of solid rook, high in some places, and
low in others. The deathlike silence
of the solitude that surrounded us impressed
us with a vague feeling of fear,
and we felt no disposition to tempt the
Devil's Gangway, especially as, in consequence
of a recent freshet, it was partly
filled with water. Our guide informed
us that beyond the Gangway were several
rooms, among which Silent Chamber
and Gothic Arch were the most
noteworthy. The portion of the cave
visited by tourists terminates in the 'Rotunda,'
eight miles from the entrance;
although explorations have been made
some miles further. The Rotunda is
cylindrical in shape, fifteen feet in diameter,
and one hundred feet in height.</p>

<p>We were now in a little room six
miles from the mouth of the cave, and
thought the present a good opportunity
to try the effect of the absence of light
and sound on the mind. Extinguishing
our lights, therefore, we resigned ourselves
to the influences of darkness and
silence. To realize such a state fully,
one must find one's self in the bowels of
the earth, as we were, where the beating
of our own hearts alone attested the
existence of life. We were glad to relight
our lamps and begin our return to
upper air.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned Annexation
Rock; near it is another curious freak of
nature, called the Tree of the World's
History. It resembles the stump of a
tree two feet in diameter, and cut off
two feet above the ground, upon which
a portion of the trunk, six feet in length,
is exactly balanced. A singular type of
the changes which time makes in the
world above-ground.</p>

<p>In the Museum, whose examination
we had postponed till our return, we
were lost in a world of wonders. It
were vain to attempt to describe or even
enumerate half of the various objects
that met us at every turn. Churches,
towers, complete with doors and windows,
as if finished by the hand of an
architect; an organ, its long and short
pipes arranged in perfect order; Lot's
Wife, a figure in stone, life size; in another
place two women, in long, flowing
garments, standing facing each other, as
if engaged in earnest conversation, and a
soldier in complete armor,&mdash;these were
among the most striking of the larger
objects. The vegetable world was also
well represented. Here was a bunch of
carrots, fresh as if just taken from the
ground, sheaves of wheat, bunches of
grain and grass hanging from the walls
and roofs. Interspersed were birds of
every species, doves in loving companionship,
sparrows, and hawks. I noticed
also in one place a pair of elephant's ears
perfect as life. Indeed it was not difficult
to believe that these stony semblances
had once been endowed with life,
and, ere blight or decay could change,
had been transmuted into things of imperishable
beauty.</p>

<p>While waiting for our guide to unmoor
the boat, which was to take us
over the lake a second time, I ran up
the bank to look at the stalactites that
hung in the greatest profusion above the
water. The light of my lamp shining
through them produced an effect as surprising
as it was beautiful. But no
words can do justice to the scene. Imagine
an immense room whose ceiling is
studded with icicles forming every conceivable
curve and angle, and you will
have only a faint idea of the number and
variety of these subterranean ornaments.</p>

<p>A mile from the entrance we found
some stray bats,&mdash;the first living creatures
we had met. We endeavored to
attract them by holding up our lamps,
and succeeded so well that we were glad
to leave them behind us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, noted by other
cave-explorers, and confirmed by our
own experience, that while within a

cave one's usual vigor and activity appears
augmented. A slight reaction
takes place on coming out into the upper
world, and renders rest doubly refreshing
and grateful.</p>

<p>Let me, in closing, advise other visitors
to Howe's Cave to choose <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">fair weather,
and take time enough</span> for their visit, as
the windings of the cave and its curiosities
are alike exhaustless.</p>

<h2>The True Interest Of Nations.</h2>


<p>For a litigious, quarrelsome, fighting
animal, man is very fond of peace. He
began to shed blood almost as soon as he
began to go alone in company with his
nearest relatives; and when Abel asked
of Cain, 'Am I not a man and a brother?'
the latter, instead of giving him the
hug fraternal, did beat him to death.
Cain's only object, it should seem, was a
quiet life, and Abel had disturbed his repose
by setting up a higher standard of
excellence than the elder brother could
afford to maintain. It was only to 'conquer
a peace' that Cain thus acted. He
desired 'indemnity for the past and security
for the future,' and so he took up
arms against his brother and ended him.
He loved peace, but he did not fear war,
because he was the stronger party of the
two, his weapons being as ready for action
as the British navy is ready for it to-day;
and Abel was as defenceless as we
were a twelvemonth ago. Cain is the
type of all mankind, who know that
peace is better than war, but who rush
into war under the pressure of envy and
pride. Ancient as violence is, it is not
so old as peace; and it is for peace that
all wars are made, at least by organized
communities. All peoples have in their
minds the idea of a golden age, not unlike
to that time so vividly described by
Hesiod, when men were absolutely good,
and therefore happy; living in perfect
accord on what the earth abundantly
gave them, suffering neither illness nor
old age, and dying as calmly as they had
lived. Historical inquiry has so far
shaken belief in the existence of any
such time as that painted by the poet,
that men have agreed to place it in the
future. It has never been, but it is to be.
It will come with that 'coming man,'

who travels so slowly, and will be by him
inaugurated, a boundless millennial time.
In the mean time contention prevails;
'war's unequal game' is played with
transcendent vigor, and at a cost that
would frighten the whole human race
into madness were it incurred for any
other purpose. But, while fighting, men
have kept their eyes steadily fixed upon
peace, which is to be the reward of their
valor and their pecuniary sacrifices. Every
warlike time has been followed by a
period in which strenuous exertions
have been made to make peace perpetual.
Never was there a more profound
desire felt for peace than that which
prevailed among the Romans of the
Augustan age, after a series of civil and
foreign wars yet unparalleled in the history
of human struggles. One poet
could denounce the first forger of the
iron sword as being truly brutal and iron-hearted;
and another could declare it to
be the 'mission' of the Romans only to
impose terms of peace upon barbarians,
who should be compelled to accept quiet
as a boon, or endure it as a burden.
Strange sentiments were these to proceed
from the land of the legions, but
they expressed the current Roman opinion,
which preferred even dishonor to
war. So was it after the settlement of
Europe in 1815. A generation that had
grown up in the course of the greatest
of modern contests produced the most
determined and persistent advocates of
the 'peace-at-any-price' policy; and for
forty years peace was preserved between
the principal Christian nations, through
the exertions of statesmen, kings, philanthropists,
and economists, who, if they
could agree in nothing else, were almost
unanimous in the opinion that war was
an expensive folly, and that the first
duty of a government was to prevent its
subjects from becoming military-mad.
Perhaps there never was a happier time
in Christendom than it knew between
the autumn of 1815 and the spring of
1854, after Napoleon had gone down
and before Nicholas had set himself up
to dictate law to the world. It was the
modern age of the Antonines, into which

was crowded more true enjoyment than
mankind had known for centuries; and
they are beginning to learn its excellence
from its loss,&mdash;war raging now in
the New World, while Europe lives in
hourly expectation of its occurrence.
There were wars, and cruel wars, too,
in those years, but they faintly affected
Europe and the United States, and probably
added something to men's happiness,
for the same reason that a storm to
which we are not exposed increases our
sense of comfort. Their thunders were
remote, and they furnished materials for
the journals. So we saw a Providence
in them, and thanked Heaven, some of
us, that we no longer furnished examples
of the folly of contention.</p>

<p>The friends of peace were actuated by
various motives. With statesmen and
politicians peace was preferred because
it was cheaper than war, and all countries
were burdened with debt. England
has sometimes been praised because
she so uniformly threw her influence
on the side of peace, after she had accomplished
her purpose in the war
against imperial France. Time and
again, she might have waged popular
wars, and in which she would have probably
been successful; but she would help
neither the Spaniards against France
and the Holy Alliance, nor the Turks
against the Russians, nor the Poles
against the Czar, nor the Hungarians
against the Austrians, nor the Italians
against the Kaiser, nor the Greeks
against the Turks. She settled all her
disputes with the United States by negotiation,
and showed no disposition to
fight with France, except when she had
all the rest of Europe on her side. But
this praise has not been deserved. England
did not quarrel with powerful countries,
because she could not afford to enter
upon costly warfare. She had gone
to the extent of her means when her
debt had reached to four thousand million
dollars, and she could not increase
that debt largely until she should also
have increased her wealth. Time was
required to add to her means, and to
lessen her debt; and to such a state had
her finances been reduced, that it is now
twenty years since she began to derive
a portion of her revenue from an income
tax, which, imposed in the time of peace,
was increased when war became inevitable.
The bonds she had given to keep
the peace were too great to admit of her
breaking it. She did not fight, because
she doubted her ability to fight successfully.
She had no wish to behold another
suspension of cash payments by her
national bank; and a general war would
be sure to bring suspension. But she
was as ready as she had ever been to
contend with the weak. The Chinese
and the Afghans did not find her very
forbearing, though with neither of those
peoples had she any just cause for war.</p>

<p>With the disunited States she has been
as prompt to quarrel as she was slow to
contend with the United States; and
now she is one of the high contracting
parties to the crusade against Mexico.
We say nothing of the Sepoy war, for
that was a contest for 'empire,' as Earl
Russell would say. She could not, in the
days of Clyde, give up what she had acquired
in the days of Clive; and no one
ought to blame her for what she did in
India, though it can not be denied that
the mutiny was the consequence of her
own bad conduct in the East. With Russia,
Austria, and Prussia to back her, in
1840, she went to the verge of a war
with France; but, in so doing, the government
did that which the English nation
by no means warmly approved;
and the fall of the whig ministry, in
1841, was in no small part due to Lord
Palmerston's policy in the preceding
year. The Russian war was brought
about by the action of the English people,
who were angry with the Czar because
his empire had the first place in
Europe. The government would have
prevented that war from breaking out
if it could, but popular pressure was too
strong for it, and it had to give way.
The event has proved that the English
government was wiser than were the
English people, France alone having
gained anything from the departure
from what had become the policy of

Europe; and for France to gain is not
altogether for the benefit of England.</p>

<p>Of the motives of the philanthropists,
we have little to say. They are always
respectable, and it is a pity that the
world should be too wicked to appreciate
them. But those of the economists are
open to remark, and the more so because
there has been so much claimed
for them. They reduced everything to
a matter of interest. Peace, they reasoned,
is for the welfare of all men;
and, if an enlightened self-interest could
be made to prevail the world over, war
would be rendered an impossibility.
Wars between civilized countries have
mostly grown out of mistaken views of
interest on the part of governments and
peoples. Once enlighten both rulers
and ruled, and make them understand
that war can not pay, and selfishness will
accomplish what religion, and morality,
and benevolence, and common sense
have failed to accomplish. Cutting
throats may be a very agreeable pastime;
but no man ever yet paid for anything
more than it was worth, with his eyes
wide open to the fact that he was not
buying a bargain, but selling himself.
Nations would be as wise as individuals,
unless it be true that the sum of intelligence
is not so great as the items that
compose it; and when it should have
been made indisputably clear that to
make war was to make losses, while
peace should be as indisputably profitable,
there would be no further occasion
to expend, annually, immense sums upon
the support of great armaments, such as
were not kept up, even in times of war,
by the potentates of earlier days. The
reason of mankind was to be appealed to,
and they were to be made saints through
the use of practical logic. Neighborhood,
instead of being regarded as cause
for enmity, was to be held as ground
for good feeling and liberal intercourse.
Under the old system it had been the
custom to call France and England 'natural
enemies,' words that attributed to
the Creator the origin of discord. Under
the new system, those great countries
were to become the best of friends,
as well as the closest of neighbors; and
one generation of free commerce was to
do away with the effects of five centuries
of disputes and warfare. England was
to forget the part which France took in
the first American war, and France was
to cease to recollect that there had been
such days as Crcy and Agincourt, Vittoria
and Waterloo; and also that England
had overthrown her rule in North
America, and driven her people from
India. But it was not France and England
only that were to enter within the
charmed circle; all nations were to be
admitted into it, and the whole world
was to fraternize. It was to be Arcadia
in a ring-fence, an Arcadia solidly based
upon heavy profits, with consols, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">rentes</span>,
and other public securities&mdash;which in
other times had a bad fashion of becoming
very insecure&mdash;always at a good
premium. Quarter-day was to be the day
for which all other days were made, and
it would never be darkened by the imposition
of new taxes, by repudiation, or
by any other of those things that so often
have lessened the felicity of the fund-holder.</p>

<p>That the new Temple of Peace might
be enabled to rise in proper proportions,
it became necessary to destroy some old
edifices, and to remove what was considered
to be very rubbishy rubbish. Protection,
tariffs, and so forth, once worshiped
as evidences of ancestral wisdom,
were to be got rid of with all possible
speed, and free trade was to be substituted,
that is, trade as free as was compatible
with the raising of enormous revenues,
made necessary by the foolish
wars of the past. In due time, perfect
freedom of trade would be had; but a
blessing of that magnitude could not be
expected to come at once to the relief
of a suffering world. England, which
had taken the lead in supporting protection,
and whose commercial system had
been of the most illiberal and sordid
character, became the leader in the
grand reform, pushing the work vigorously
forward, and, with her usual consideration
for the feelings and rights of
others, ordering the nations of Europe

and America to follow her example.
She had discovered that she had been
all in the wrong since the day when Oliver
St. John's wounded pride led him to
the conclusion that it was the duty of
every patriotic Englishman to do his
best to destroy the commerce of Holland.
She was very impatient of those
peoples who were shy of imitating her,
forgetting that her conduct through six
generations had made a strong impression
on the world's mind, and that her
sudden conversion could not immediately
avail against her long persistence
in sinning against political economy, if
indeed she had so sinned; and the question
was one that admitted of some dispute,
free trade being but an experiment.
Gradually, however, men came
round to the British view, in theory at
least; and among the intelligent classes
it was admitted that commerce without
restriction was the true policy of nations,
which must be gradually adopted as the
basis of all future action, due regard to
be paid to those potent disturbing forces,
vested interests. France was slow to
yield in practice, though she had produced
some of the cleverest of economical
writers; for she is as little given to
change in matters of business as she is
ready to rush into political revolutions.
But even France at last gave signs of
her intention to abandon her ancient
practice in deference to modern theories;
and Napoleon III. and Mr. Cobden
laid their wise heads together to form
plans for the completion of the 'cordial
understanding,' on the basis of free
trade. Less than forty years had sufficed
to effect a gradual change of human
opinion, and protection seemed
about to be sent to that limbo in which
witchcraft, alchemy, and judicial astrology
have been so long undisturbedly reposing.</p>

<p>Death, we are told, found his way into
Arcadia; and disappointment was not
long in coming to disturb the modern
Arcadians, who had as much to do with
cotton as their predecessors with wool.
The dream of universal peace, a peace
that was to endure because based on enlightened
selfishness,&mdash;that is to say
on buying in cheap markets and selling
in dear ones,&mdash;was as rudely dispelled
as had been all earlier dreams of the
kind. Interest, it was found, could no
more make men live lovingly together
than principle could cause them to do so
in by-gone times. If there were two nations
that might have been insured not
to fight each other, because interest was
sufficient to prevent men from having
resort to war, those nations were Russia
and England. They were in no sense
rivals, according to the definition of
rivalry in the circles of commerce. Between
them there was much buying
and selling, to the great profit of both.
England is an old nation, with the arts
of industry developed among her people
to an extent that is elsewhere unknown.
The division of labor that prevails among
her working people is so extensive and
so minute, that in that respect she defies
comparison. Other countries may have
as skillful laborers as she possesses, but
their industry is of a far less various
character. Russia is a new country,
and she requires what England has to
dispose of; and England finds her account
in purchasing the raw materials
that are so abundantly produced in
Russia. Commercially speaking, therefore,
these two nations could not fall
out, could not quarrel, could not fight,
if they would. In all other respects,
too, they could be counted upon to set
a good example to all other communities.
They had more than once been
allies, each had done the other good services
at critical tunes, and they had had
the foremost places in that grand alliance
which had twice dethroned Napoleon
I. The exceptions to their general
good understanding belong to those exceptions
which are supposed to be useful
in proving a given rule. When the
tory rulers of England became alarmed
because of the success of Catharine II.
in her second Turkish war, and proposed
doing what was done more than sixty
years later,&mdash;to assist the Osmanlis,&mdash;the
opposition to their policy became so
powerful that even the strong ministry

of William Pitt had to listen to its voice;
which shows that the tendency of English
opinion was then favorable to Russia.
The hostility of Czar Paul to England,
in his last days, is attributed to the
failure of his mind; and the immediate
resumption of good relations between the
two countries after his death, establishes
the fact that the English and the Russians
were not sharers in the Czar's feelings.
During the five years that followed
Tilsit, Russia appeared to be the
enemy of England, and war existed for
some time between the two empires; but
this was owing to the ascendency of the
French, Alexander having to choose between
England and France. The nominal
enemies did each other as little injury
as possible; and, in 1812, they became
greater friends than ever. Most
Englishmen were probably of Lord Holland's
opinion, that England's interest
dictated a Russian connection; and in
the eighteenth century England was, in
some sense, the nursing mother of the
new empire, though once or twice she
was inclined to do as other nurses have
done,&mdash;administer some punishment to
the rude and healthy child she was fostering,
and not without reason. So harmonious
had been the relations of these two
magnificent states, that an eminent Russian
author, Dr. Hamel, writing in 1846,
could say: 'Nearly three hundred years
have now elapsed since England greeted
Muscovy at the mouth of the Dwina. So
great have been the benefits to trade,
the arts, and industry in general, arising
from the friendly relations between England
and Russia, which, in 1853, will
have completed the third century of
their continuance, that one might expect
to see this period closed, in both countries,
with a jubilee to commemorate so
remarkable an example of uninterrupted
amicable intercourse between nations.'

The year 1853 came; but, instead of being
a jubilee to the old friends of three
centuries' standing, it brought the beginning
of that contest which is known as
the Russian war. That was a proper
way, indeed, to notice the happy return
of the three-hundredth anniversary of
the establishment of 'uninterrupted amicable
intercourse' between the nations,
whose soldiers were soon slaughtering
each other with as much energy as if
they had been 'natural enemies' from
immemorial time. Interest had no power
to turn aside the storm of war. The
English people were angry with Russia
because the iron-willed Czar had carried
matters in Europe with a very high
hand, and was, in fact, virtually master
of the Old World, and suspected of being
on uncommonly good terms with the
masters of the New World. Nicholas
had succeeded to the place of Napoleon
in their ill graces. They liked the Cossackry
of the one as little as they had
liked the cannonarchy of the other. It
was a case of pure jealousy. Russia was
too powerful to suit the English idea of
the fitness of things, and therefore it
was necessary that she should be chastised
and humbled. Fear of Russia
there could have been none in the English
mind. It has been thought that
England contended for the safety of her
Eastern dominions; but then the Czar
offered her Egypt and Candia, possession
of which would not only have much
strengthened her Indian empire, but
have been the means of making her
more powerful at home. Nothing better
could have been offered for her acceptance,
if valuable territories would have
satisfied her feelings; and much praise
has been bestowed upon her because she
did not close with the Czar's proposition
'to share and share alike' the lands of
the House of Othman; but that praise
is not quite deserved, the desire not to
see Russia aggrandized being a stronger
sentiment with her than was the desire
to aggrandize herself. Had the question
been left for British statesmen alone
to settle,&mdash;had the British premier been
as free to act for England as the Czar
was for Russia,&mdash;poor, sick Turkey
would have been cut and carved most
expeditiously and artistically; she would
have been partitioned as perfectly as
Poland, and Abdul Medjid would have
experienced the fate of Stanislaus Poniatowski.
But English ministers hold

power only on condition of doing the
will of the English nation, and that nation
had contracted an aversion to Russia
that was uncontrollable, and before
its hostility its ministers had to give way,
slowly and reluctantly; and the half-measures
they adopted, like the half-measures
of our own government toward
the secessionists, explain the disasters
of the war. The English people
were determined that there should be an
end, for the time at least, to the Russian
hegemony, and threw themselves into
the arms of France with a vivacity that
would have astonished any other French
ruler but Napoleon III., who had lived
among them, and who knew them well.
The war was waged, and, when over,
what had England gained? Nothing
solid, it must be admitted. The territory
of Russia remained unimpaired, and
there is not the slightest evidence that
her influence in the East was lessened
by the partial destruction of Sebastopol.
The Russian navy of the Euxine had
ceased to exist; but as it consisted principally
of vessels that were not adapted
to the purposes of modern warfare, the
loss of the Russians in that respect was
not of a very serious character. Russia's
European leadership was suspended;
but her power and her resources,
which, if properly employed, must soon
reinstate her, were not damaged. England

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">had</span> fought for an idea, and had
fought in vain.</p>

<p>France had as little interest in the
Russian war as England, and the French
people had no wish to fight the Czar.
They would have preferred fighting the
English, in connection with the Czar,&mdash;an
arrangement that would have been
more profitable to their country. But
the emperor had a quarrel with his arrogant
brother at St. Petersburgh, and
he availed himself of the opportunity
afforded by that brother's obstinacy to
teach him a lesson from which he did
not live to profit. Nicholas had cut the
new emperor, and had caused him to be
taboo'd by most of the sovereigns of Europe;
and the Frenchman determined
to cut his way to consideration. This
he was enabled to do, with the aid of the
English; and ever since the war's close
he has held the place which became vacant
on the death of Nicholas&mdash;that of
Europe's arbiter. The French fought
well, as they always do, but their heart
was not in the war. The emperor had
the war party pretty much to himself.
Exactly the opposite state of things existed
in France to that which existed in
England. In the former country, the
government was for war, and the people
were for peace; in the latter, the government
was for peace, and the people
were for war. In each country power
was in the hands of the war party, and
so war was made, in spite of the wishes
of the French people and of English
statesmen. When Napoleon III. had accomplished
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">his</span> purpose, he ordered the
English to make peace, and peace was
made. In this way he satisfied his subjects,
showing them that he had no intention
of making England more powerful
than she had been, or Russia weaker.
He had prevented Russia from extending
her dominion, but he had also
prevented England from lessening that
dominion.</p>

<p>The Italian war was waged in opposition
to the sentiments of the French people,
which was one of the leading causes
of its sudden termination, with its object,
only half accomplished, and much to the
damage of the emperor's reputation for
statesmanship and courage. Whether,
in a comprehensive sense, that war was
entered upon for purposes adverse to the
interests of France, may well be doubted;
but it is certain that it was an unpopular
measure in that country. The
French had no objection to the humiliation
of Austria; but it would be a grave
error to suppose that they have any wish
to behold Italy united and powerful. The
kingdom of Italy, should it become all
that is desired for it by its friends in this
country, would be to France a source
of annoyance, and probably of danger.
The emperor's power was shaken by his
Italian policy, and hence it was that he
played the confederature game so long,
to the astonishment of foreigners, and got

possession of Savoy and Nice, to the astonishment
and anger of England; and
hence it is that he is seeking Sardinia
and other portions of Italy. Thus, the
Italian war was begun against the interests
of the French people, or what that
people believe to be their interests,
though this is the age in which there is
to be peace, because that is not to be
broken except when popular interests
require that it shall no longer be preserved.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable instance of
the fallacy of the idea that regard for the
true interests of nations must banish hostilities
from the world, is afforded by the
coarse of France and England toward
this country since the beginning of the
secession war. Both those countries
have great interest not only in the preservation
of peace <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">with</span> the United
States, but in the preservation of peace
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">in</span> the United States; and yet they have
done all that it lies in their power to do
to encourage our rebels, and have been
on the verge of war with us: and war
with them, and with Spain, is exported
by many Americans, who judge of the
future by the present and the past.
England had a vast trade with the
American Union, buying at the South,
and selling to the North, and hence any
disturbances here were sure to operate
adversely to her interests; but no sooner
had it become apparent that our troubles
were to be of a serious character,
than her weight was thrown on to the
side of the rebels, who never would have
been able to do much but for the encouragement
they have received from
abroad. The trade of France was not
so great with America as that of England;
yet it was valuable, and the
French have suffered much from its suspension,
perhaps we should say its loss.
The North has purchased but little from
Europe for a year, and the South has
sold less to Europe in that time. There
has been a trade in food between the
North and some European countries, in
which grain has been exchanged for
gold, though it would have been better
for both parties could anything else
than gold have been brought to America,
true commerce consisting in the interchange
of commodities. For all the
sufferings that have been experienced
by Englishmen and Frenchmen, they
have none but themselves and their governments
to censure. That peace has
not been preserved is not our fault; and
the war that has been blown into so fierce
a flame has been fed from Europe; it
has been fanned by breezes from France
and England. When it was first seen
that there was danger of civil war, the
governments of those countries, if they
had really had any regard for the true
interests of their countries, would have
discouraged the rebels in the most public
and pointed manner imaginable, not
because they cared for us, but for the
simple reason that they were bound so
to act as should best promote the welfare
of their own peoples. War in
America meant suffering to the artisans
and laborers of Europe, who, thus far,
have suffered more from the war than
have any portion of the American people,
except the residents of Southern
cities. Napoleon III. and Lord Palmerston
should have said to the agents of the
Confederacy, and have taken care to
publish their words, 'We can afford you
neither aid in deeds nor encouragement
in words. Our relations with both sections
of the American nation are such,
that our respective countries must suffer
immensely from the course which you
are about to pursue, not because you
have been oppressed, or fear oppression,
but because you have been beaten in an
election, and power, for the time, has
been taken from your hands. You ask
us to act hostilely against the established
government of the United States, that
government having given us no cause of
offense,&mdash;to become the patrons of a
revolution that has no cause, but the
consequences of which may be boundless.
To revolutions we are averse; and one
of our governments exists in virtue of
opposition to the party of disorder in
Europe. You ask us to do that which
would lessen the means of livelihood to
millions of our people; for, granting

that you should succeed, still there would
necessarily be so great a change produced
by your action, and by our intervention
in American affairs, that for
years America would not be the good
customer to France and England that
she has been for a generation. With the
merits of your cause we can have nothing
to do, our true interests pointing to
the maintenance of the strictest neutrality
in the contest between you and the
federal government; and the dictates
of interest are fortified by the suggestions
of principle. Your movement is
essentially disorderly in its character,
and it is undertaken avowedly in the interest
of slavery; and not only are we
the supporters of the existing order of
things the world over, but we are hostile
to slavery, having abolished it in all
parts of our dominions. Our advice to
you is, to submit to the federal government,
and to seek for the redress of your
grievances, if such you have, by means
recognized in the constitution and laws
of your country. From us you can receive
no aid, and you should dismiss all
expectation of it from your minds at
once and forever. We are indifferent
to the form of the American government,
and its internal policy can not concern
us; but the interests of our peoples
require that we should live in peace with
the people of America, whether they be
of the South or of the North, slave-holders
or abolitionists; and we shall not
quarrel with any portion of them for the
sake of facilitating the erection of a republic
to be founded on the basis of the
divine nature of slavery, the first time
that so preposterous a pretension was
ever put forward by the audacity or the
impudence of men.' Had something like
this been said to the agents of the rebels,
and had the English press supported the
same views, the rebellion would have
been at an end ere this, and the commercial
relations of America and Europe
would have experienced no sensible interruption.
English interests, in an especial
sense, demanded that the rebels
should be discouraged, and discouragement
from London would have rendered
rebellion hopeless, and have promoted
peace in Savannah and New Orleans.</p>

<p>But it was not in England's nature to
pursue a course that would have been as
much in harmony with her material interests
as with that high moral character
which she claims as being peculiarly
her own. There appeared to have presented
itself an opportunity to effect the
destruction of the American Republic,
and England could not resist the temptation
to strike us hard: and, for almost
a year, she has been to the Union a
more deadly foe than we have found in
the South. We do not allude to the
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Trent</span> question, for in that we were
clearly in the wrong, and Mason and
Slidell should have been released on the
16th of November, and not have been
detained in captivity six weeks. Secretary
Seward has placed the point so
emphatically beyond all doubt, that we
must all be of one mind thereon, whether
in England or America. England
might have been moderate in her action,
in view of her repeated outrages on the
rights of neutrals, but no intelligent
American can condemn her position. It
is to other things that we must look for
evidence of her determination to effect
our extinction as a nation. She has,
while dripping with Hindoo blood, and
while yet men's ears are filled with accounts
of the blowing of sepoys from the
muzzles of cannon by her military executioners,
absolutely demanded of us an acknowledgment
of the Southern Confederacy's
independence, on the ground
that it is inhuman to wage war for the
maintenance of our national life. She
has compared our mild and forbearing
government with the savage proconsulate
of Alva in the Netherlands! She
has charged us with waging war against
civilization, because we have employed
stone fleets to close entrances to the harbor
of Charleston, though her own history
is full of instances of their employment
for similar purposes! She has
encouraged her traders and seamen to
furnish the rebels with arms of all kinds,
and stores of every description! She
has excluded our ships-of-war from her

ports, refusing to allow them to coal at
places at which she had granted us the
privilege, in time of peace, of establishing
stations for fuel! She has given
shelter and protection to the privateers
of the rebels, vessels that had violated
her own laws almost within sight of her
own shores, and certainly within the narrow
seas! She has acknowledged the
belligerent character of the South, which
is virtually an acknowledgment of its
independence, for none but nations can
lawfully wage war. She has, through
her Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared
that our war with the secessionists
is of the same character as the war
which the Spaniards carried on with
their American colonists, and that there
is no difference between it and the
attempt of the Turks to subdue the
Greeks! Monstrous perversions of history
for even Earl Russell to be guilty of!
Her leading periodicals and journals,
with few exceptions, have denounced our
country, our course, and our government
in the bitterest language, and to the
manifest encouragement of the rebels,
who see in their language the rapid
growth and prompt exhibition of a sentiment
of hostility to this country, and
which must, sooner or later, end in war;
and war between England and America
would be sure to lead to the success of
the Confederates, even if we should
come out of it victoriously.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the attempt to establish
peace on the basis of the true interests
of nations has not only failed, but
that it has failed signally and deplorably.
The solid Doric Temple of Mammon
has no more been able to stand
against the storms of war than has the
Crystal Palace of Sentiment. The fair
fabric which was the type of materialism
has fallen, and it would be most unwise
to seek its reconstruction. That
which was to have stood as long and
as firmly as the Pyramids has fallen
before the first moss could gather upon
it. Nor is the reason of this fall far
to seek, as it lies upon the surface, and
ought to have been anticipated&mdash;would
have been, only that men are so ready
to believe in what they wish to believe.
England, as a nation, has two interests
to consult, and which do not always accord.
She has her commercial interest
and her imperial interest; and, when
the two conflict, the last is sure to become
first. Her position as a nation was
threatened only by the United States
and Russia. The dynastic disputes of
France, which are far from being at an
end, and the generally unsettled character
of French politics, must long prevent
that country from becoming the permanent
rival of England. France is great
to-day, and England acts wisely in preparing
to meet her in war; but to-morrow
France may become weak, and her
voice be feeble and her weight light in
Europe and the world. Three houses
claim her throne, and the Republicans
may start up into active life again, as
we saw they did in 1848. Neither Austria
nor Prussia can ever furnish England
cause of alarm. With Russia the
case is very different, as her government
is solidly established; her resources are
vast, and in the course of steady development,
and her desire to establish her
supremacy in the East is a fixed idea
with both rulers and ruled. Unchecked,
she would have thrown England into
the background, and supposing that she
had resolved not to allow that country
a share of the spoil of Turkey. The
hard character and harsh policy of
Nicholas ended in furnishing to England
an opportunity to throw Russia herself
into the background for the time, and
that opportunity she made use of, but
not to the extent that she had determined
upon, owing to her dependence
upon France, which became the shield
of Russia after having been the sword
of England. The United States were a
formidable rival of England; and, but
for the breaking out of our troubles, we
should have been far ahead of her by
1870, and perhaps have stripped her of
all her American possessions. When
those troubles began, she proceeded to
take the same advantage of them that
she had taken of the Czar's blunder.
To sever the American nation in twain is

her object, as some of her public men
have frankly avowed; and she believes
that the disintegrating process, once commenced,
would not stop with the division
of the country into the Northern Union
and the Southern Confederacy. She
expects, should the South succeed, to see
half a dozen republics here established,
and is not without hope that not even
two States would remain together; and
for this hope she has very good foundation.
The American nation destroyed,
England would become as great in the
West as she is in the East, and would
hold, with far greater means at her command,
the same position that was hers
in the last days of George II., when the
French had been expelled from America
and India. She would have no commercial
rival, and there would no longer
be an American navy susceptible of gigantic
increase. She would be truly the
sea's sovereign; and whoso rules the
sea has power to dictate to the land.
'Whosoever commands the sea,' says
Sir Walter Raleigh, 'commands the
trade of the world; whosoever commands
the trade of the world, commands
the riches of the world, and consequently
the world itself.' England never
would have gone to war with the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">United
States</span> to prevent their growth; but, now
that they have instituted civil war, it is
certain that she will do all that lies in
her power to prevent the reconstruction
of the Union. The war of words has
been begun, and it is but preliminary to
the war of swords. The savage music
of the British press is the overture to the
opera. The morality of England may
be neither higher nor lower than that of
all other countries,&mdash;may be no worse
than our own,&mdash;but there is so much
that is offensive in her modes of exhibiting
her destitution of principle, that she
is more hated than all other powerful
countries that ever have existed. She
not only sins as badly as other nations,
but manages to make herself as odious
for her manner of sinning as for the sins
themselves. There is no crime that she
is not capable of, if its perpetration be
necessary to promote her own power.
When Sir William Reid was governor
of Malta, he said to Mr. Lushington, 'I
would let them (<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> the heathen) set up
Juggernaut in St. George's Square (in
Edinburgh), if it were conducive to England's
holding Malta.' And as this
time-blue Presbyterian was ready to allow
the solemnization of the bloodiest
rites of paganism in the most public
place of the Christian city of Edinburgh,
if that kind of tolerance would be conducive
to England's retention of Malta,&mdash;of
which she holds possession, by the
way, in consequence of one of the grossest
breaches of faith mentioned even in
her history,&mdash;so do we find the Christian
people, peers, and priests of England
ready to become the allies of slave-holders
and the supporters of slavery, if
thereby the American Republic can be
destroyed, as they believe that its existence
may become the source of danger
to the ascendency of their country.</p>

<p>The last intelligence from England
allows us to believe that that country has
adopted a more liberal policy, and that
her government will do nothing to aid
the rebels. Some of the language of
Ministers is friendly, and altogether the
change is one of a character that can
not be otherwise than agreeable to us.
France, too, has declared her neutrality
as strongly as England. These declarations
were made before intelligence of
our military and naval successes had
reached Europe, which renders them all
the more weighty. Peace between
America and Europe may, therefore, be
counted upon, unless some very great
reverses should befall our arms.</p>

<h2>Among The Pines.</h2>


<p>The 'Ole Cabin' to which Jim had
alluded as the scene of Sam's punishment
by the Overseer, was a one-story
shanty in the vicinity of the stables.
Though fast falling to decay, it had more
the appearance of a decent habitation
than the other huts on the plantation.
Its thick plank door was ornamented
with a mouldy brass knocker, and its
four windows contained sashes, to which
here and there clung a broken pane, the
surviving relic of its better days. It was
built of large unhewn logs, notched at
the ends and laid one upon the other,
with the bark still on. The thick, rough
coat which yet adhered in patches to the
timber had opened in the sun, and let
the rain and the worm burrow in its sides,
till some parts had crumbled entirely
away. At one corner the process of decay
had gone on till roof, superstructure,
and foundation had rotted down
and left an opening large enough to admit
a coach and four horses. The huge
chimneys which had graced the gable-ends
of the building were fallen in, leaving
only a mass of sticks and clay to tell
of their existence, and two wide openings
to show how great a figure they had
once made in the world. A small space
in front of the cabin would have been a
lawn, had the grass been willing to grow
upon it; and a few acres of cleared land
in its rear might have passed for a garden,
had it not been entirely overgrown with
young pines and stubble. This primitive
structure was once the 'mansion' of that
broad plantation, and, before the production
of turpentine came into fashion
in that region, its rude owner drew his
support from its few surrounding acres,
more truly independent than the present
aristocratic proprietor, who, raising only
one article, and buying all his provisions,
was forced to draw his support from the
Yankee or the Englishman.</p>

<p>Only one room, about forty feet square,
occupied the interior of the cabin. It
once contained several apartments, vestiges
of which still remained, but the
partitions had been torn away to fit it
for its present uses. What those uses
were, a moment's observation showed
me.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor, which was
mostly rotted away, a space about fifteen
feet square was covered with thick pine
planking, strongly nailed to the beams.
In the centre of this planking an oaken
block was firmly bolted, and to it was
fastened a strong iron staple that held a
log-chain, to which was attached a pair
of shackles. Above this, was a queer
frame-work of oak, somewhat resembling
the contrivance for drying fruit I have
seen in Yankee farm-houses. Attached
to the rafters by stout pieces of timber,
were two hickory poles, placed horizontally,
and about four feet apart, the
lower one rather more than eight feet
from the floor. This was the whipping-rack,
and hanging to it were several
stout whips with short hickory handles,
and long triple lashes. I took one down
for closer inspection, and found burned
into the wood, in large letters, the words
'Moral Suasion.' I questioned the appropriateness
of the label, but the Colonel
insisted with great gravity that the
whip is the only 'moral suasion' a darky
is capable of understanding.</p>

<p>When punishment is inflicted on one
of the Colonel's negroes, his feet are confined
in the shackles, his arms tied above
his head, and drawn by a stout cord up
to one of the horizontal poles; then, his
back bared to the waist, and standing
on tip-toe, with every muscle stretched
to its utmost tension, he takes 'de lashes.'</p>

<p>A more severe but more unusual punishment
is the 'thumb-screw.' In this
a noose is passed around the negro's
thumb and fore-finger, while the cord
is thrown over the upper cross-pole, and
the culprit is drawn up till his toes barely
touch the ground. In this position

the whole weight of the body rests on the
thumb and fore-finger. The torture is
excruciating, and strong, able-bodied
men can endure it but a few moments.
The Colonel naively told me that he had
discontinued its practice, as several of his
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">women</span> had nearly lost the use of their
hands, and been incapacited for field
labor, by its too frequent repetition.
'My &mdash;&mdash; drivers,'<a href="#note_12"><span class="footnoteref">12</span></a> he added, 'have no
discretion, and no humanity; if they
have a pique against a nigger, they show
him no mercy.'</p>

<p>The old shanty I have described was
now the place of the Overseer's confinement.
Open as it was at top, bottom, and
sides, it seemed an unsafe prison-house;
but Jim had rendered its present occupant
secure by placing 'de padlocks on
him.'</p>

<p>'Where did you catch him?' asked
the Colonel of Jim, as, followed by every
darky on the plantation, we took our
way to the old building.</p>

<p>'In de swamp, massa. We got Sandy
and de dogs arter him&mdash;dey treed
him, but he fit like de debil.'</p>

<p>'Any one hurt?'</p>

<p>'Yas, Cunnel; he knifed Yaller Jake,
and ef I hadn't a gibin him a wiper,
you'd a had anudder nigger short dis
mornin'&mdash;shore.'</p>

<p>'How was it? tell me,' said his master,
while we paused, and the darkies gathered
around.</p>

<p>'Wal, yer see, massa, we got de ole
debil's hat dat he drapped wen you had
him down; den we went to Sandy's fur
de dogs&mdash;dey scented him to onst, and
off dey put for de swamp. 'Bout twenty
on us follored 'em. He'd a right smart
start on us, and run like a deer, but de
hounds kotched up wid him 'bout whar
he shot pore Sam. He fit 'em and cut
up de Lady awful, but ole Caesar got a
hole ob him, and sliced a breakfuss out
ob his legs. Somehow, dough, he got
away from de ole dog, and clum a tree.

'T was more'n an hour afore we kotched
up; but dar he war, and de houns baying
'way as ef dey know'd wat an ole
debil he am. I'd tuk one ob de guns&mdash;you
warn't in de hous, massa, so I cudn't
ax you.'</p>

<p>'Never mind that; go on,' said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Wal, I up wid de gun, and tole him
ef he didn't cum down I'd gib him suffin'

dat 'ud sot hard on de stummuk. It tuk
him a long w'ile, but&mdash;he <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">cum down</span>.'
Here the darky showed a row of ivory
that would have been a fair capital for
a metropolitan dentist.</p>

<p>'Wen he war down,' he resumed, 'Jake
war gwine to tie him, but de ole 'gator,
quicker dan a flash, put a knife enter
him.'</p>

<p>'Is Jake much hurt?' interrupted the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Not bad, massa; de knife went fru
his arm, and enter his ribs, but de ma'am
hab fix him up, and she say he'll be
'round bery sudden.'</p>

<p>'Well, what then?' inquired the Colonel.</p>

<p>'Wen de ole debil seed he hadn't finished
Jake, he war gwine to gib him
anoder dig, but jus den I drap de gun on
his cocoa-nut, and he neber trubble us
no more. 'Twar mons'rous hard work
to git him out ob de swamp, 'cause he
war jes like a dead man, and we had to
tote him de hull way; but he'm dar now,
massa (pointing to the old cabin), and
de bracelets am on him.'</p>

<p>'Where is Jake?' asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>'Dunno, massa, but reckon he'm to
hum.'</p>

<p>'One of you boys go and bring him to
the cabin,' said the Colonel.</p>

<p>A negro-man went off on the errand,
while we and the darkies resumed our
way to the Overseer's quarters. Arrived
there, I witnessed a scene that
words can not picture.</p>

<p>Stretched at full length on the floor,
his clothes torn to shreds, his coarse carroty
hair matted with blood, and his
thin, ugly visage pale as death, lay the
Overseer. Bending over him, wiping
away the blood from his face, and swathing
a ghastly wound on his forehead, was
the negress Sue; while at his shackled
feet, binding up his still bleeding legs,
knelt the octoroon woman.</p>


<p>'Is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">she</span> here?' I said, involuntarily, as
I caught sight of the group.</p>

<p>'It's her nature,' said the Colonel,
with a pleasant smile; 'if Moye were the
devil himself, she'd do him good if she
could; another such woman never lived.'</p>

<p>And yet this woman, with all the instincts
that make her sex angel-ministers
to man, lived in daily violation of the
most sacred of all laws,&mdash;because she
was a slave. Will Mr. Caleb Cushing
or Charles O'Conner please tell us why
the Almighty invented a system which
forces his creatures to break the laws of
His own making?</p>

<p>'Don't waste your time on him, Alice,'
said the Colonel, kindly; 'he isn't worth
the rope that'll hang him.'</p>

<p>'He was bleeding to death; he must
have care or he'll die,' said the octoroon
woman.</p>

<p>'Then let him die, d&mdash;&mdash; him,' replied
the Colonel, advancing to where the
Overseer lay, and bending down to satisfy
himself of his condition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile more than two hundred
dusky forms crowded around and filled
every opening of the old building. Every
conceivable emotion, except pity, was
depicted on their dark faces. The same
individuals whose cloudy visages a half-hour
before I had seen distended with a
wild mirth and careless jollity, that made
me think them really the docile, good-natured
animals they are said to be, now
glared on the prostrate Overseer with
the infuriated rage of aroused beasts
when springing on their prey.</p>

<p>'You can't come the possum here.
Get up, you &mdash;&mdash; hound,' said the Colonel,
rising and striking the bleeding
man with his foot.</p>

<p>The fellow raised himself on one elbow
and gazed around with a stupid, vacant
look. His eye wandered unsteadily for
a moment from the Colonel to the throng
of cloudy faces in the doorway; then, his
recent experience flashing upon him, he
shrieked out, clinging wildly to the skirts
of the octoroon woman, who was standing
near, 'Keep off them cursed hounds,&mdash;keep
them off, I say&mdash;they'll kill
me!&mdash;they'll kill me!'</p>

<p>One glance satisfied me that his mind
was wandering. The blow on the head
had shattered his reason, and made the
strong man less than a child.</p>

<p>'You shan't be killed yet,' said the
Colonel. 'You've a small account to settle
with me before you reckon with the
devil.'</p>

<p>At this moment the dark crowd in the
doorway parted, and Jake entered, his
arm bound up and in a sling.</p>

<p>'Jake, come here,' said the Colonel;
'this man would have killed you. What
shall we do with him?'</p>

<p>''Tain't fur a darky to say dat, massa,'
said the negro, evidently unaccustomed
to the rude administration of justice
which the Colonel was about to inaugurate;
'he did wuss dan dat to Sam, mass&mdash;he
orter swing for shootin' him.'</p>

<p>'That's <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">my</span> affair; we'll settle your
account first,' replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>The darky looked undecidedly at his
master, and then at the Overseer, who,
overcome by weakness, had sunk again
to the floor. The little humanity in him
was evidently struggling with his hatred
of Moye and his desire of revenge, when
the old nurse yelled out from among the
crowd, 'Gib him fifty lashes, Massa Davy,
and den you wash him down.<a href="#note_13"><span class="footnoteref">13</span></a> Be
a man, Jake, and say dat.'</p>

<p>Jake still hesitated, and when at last
he was about to speak, the eye of the
octoroon woman caught his, and chained
the words to his tongue, as if by magnetic
power.</p>

<p>'Do you say that, boys;' said the Colonel,
turning to the other negroes;
'shall he have fifty lashes?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa, fifty lashes&mdash;gib de ole
debil fifty lashes,' shouted about fifty
voices.</p>

<p>'He shall have them,' quietly said the
master.</p>

<p>The mad shout that followed, which
was more like the yell of demons than
the cry of men, seemed to arouse the
Overseer to a sense of the real state of
affairs. Springing to his feet, he gazed

wildly around; then, sinking on his knees
before the octoroon, and clutching the
folds of her dress, he shrieked, 'Save me,
good lady, save me! as you hope for
mercy, save me!'</p>

<p>Not a muscle of her face moved, but,
turning to the excited crowd, she mildly
said, 'Fifty lashes would kill him. <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Jake</span>
does not say that&mdash;your master leaves
it to him, and he will not whip a dying
man&mdash;will you, Jake?'</p>

<p>'No, ma'am&mdash;not&mdash;not ef you go
agin it,' replied the negro, with very evident
reluctance.</p>

<p>'But he whipped Sam, ma'am, when
he was nearer dead than <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">he</span> am,' said
Jim, whose station as house-servant allowed
him a certain freedom of speech.</p>

<p>'Because he was brutal to Sam, should
you be brutal to him? Can you expect
me to tend you when you are sick, if you
beat a dying man? Does Pompey say
you should do such things?' said the lady.</p>

<p>'No, good ma'am,' said the old preacher,
stepping out, with the freedom of an
old servant, from the black mass, and
taking his stand beside me in the open
space left for the 'w'ite folks;' 'de ole
man dusn't say dat, ma'am; he tell 'em
de Lord want 'em to forgib dar en'mies&mdash;to
lub dem dat pursyskute em;' then,
turning to the Colonel, he added, as he
passed his hand meekly over his thin
crop of white wool and threw his long
heel back, 'ef massa'll 'low me I'll talk
to 'em.'</p>

<p>'Fire away,' said the Colonel, with
evident chagrin. 'This is a nigger trial;
if you want to screen the d&mdash;&mdash; hound
you can do it.'</p>

<p>'I dusn't want to screed him, massa,
but I'se bery ole and got soon to gwo,
and I dusn't want de blessed Lord to ax
me wen I gets dar why I 'lowed dese
pore ig'nant brack folks to mudder a
man 'fore my bery face. I toted you,
massa, fore you cud gwo, I'se worked for
you till I can't work no more; and I
dusn't want to tell de Lord dat <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">my</span> massa
let a brudder man be killed in cole
blood.'</p>

<p>'He is no brother of mine, you old
fool; preach to the nigs, don't preach to
me,' said the Colonel, stifling his displeasure,
and striding off through the black
crowd, without saying another word.</p>

<p>Here and there in the dark mass a
face showed signs of relenting; but much
the larger number of that strange jury,
had the question been put, would have
voted&mdash;DEATH.</p>

<p>The old preacher turned to them as
the Colonel passed out, and said, 'My
chil'ren, would you hab dis man whipped,
so weak, so dyin' as he am, of he war
brack?'</p>

<p>'No, not ef he war a darky&mdash;fer
den he wouldn't be such an ole debil,' replied
Jim, and about a dozen of the other
negroes.</p>

<p>'De w'ite ain't no wuss dan de brack&mdash;dey'm
all 'like&mdash;pore sinners all ob 'em.
De Lord wudn't whip a w'ite man no
sooner dan a brack one&mdash;He tinks de
w'ite juss so good as de brack (good
Southern doctrine, I thought). De porest
w'ite trash wudn't strike a man wen
he war down.'</p>

<p>'We'se had 'nough of dis, ole man,'
said a large, powerful negro (one of the
drivers), stepping forward, and, regardless
of the presence of Madam P&mdash;&mdash; and
myself, pressing close to where the Overseer
lay, now totally unconscious of what
was passing around him. 'You needn't
preach no more; de Cunnul hab say
we'm to whip ole Moye, and we'se gwine
to do it, by &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>I felt my fingers closing on the palm
of my hand, and in a second more they
would have cut the darky's profile, had
not Madam P&mdash;&mdash; cried out, 'Stand back,
you impudent fellow: say another word,
and I'll have you whipped on the spot.'</p>

<p>'De Cunnul am my massa, ma'am&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">he</span>
say ole Moye shall be whipped, and I'se
gwine to do it&mdash;shore.'</p>

<p>I have seen a storm at sea&mdash;I have
seen the tempest tear up great trees&mdash;I
have seen the lightning strike in a dark
night&mdash;but I never saw anything half
so grand, half so terrible, as the glance
and tone of that woman as she cried out,
'Jim, take this man&mdash;give him fifty
lashes this instant.'</p>

<p>Quicker than thought, a dozen darkies

were on him. His hands and feet were
tied and he was under the whipping-rack
in a second. Turning then to the other
negroes, the brave woman said, 'Some of
you carry Moye to the house, and you,
Jim, see to this man&mdash;if fifty lashes don't
make him sorry, give him fifty more.'</p>

<p>This summary change of programme
was silently acquiesced in by the assembled
darkies, but many a cloudy face
scowled sulkily on the octoroon, as, leaning
on my arm, she followed Junius and
the other negroes, who bore Moye to the
mansion. It was plain that under those
dark faces a fire was burning that a
breath would have fanned into a flame.</p>

<p>We entered the house by its rear door,
and placed Moye in a small room on the
ground floor. He was laid on a bed, and
stimulants being given him, his senses
and reason shortly returned. His eyes
opened, and his real position seemed suddenly
to flash upon him, for he turned to
Madam P&mdash;&mdash;, and in a weak voice,
half-choked with emotion, faltered out,
'May God in heaven bless ye, ma'am;
God <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">will</span> bless ye for bein' so good to a
wicked man like me. I doesn't desarve it,
but ye woant leave me&mdash;ye woant leave
me&mdash;they'll kill me ef ye do!'</p>

<p>'Don't fear,' said the Madam; 'you
shall have a fair trial. No harm shall
come to you here.'</p>

<p>'Thank ye, thank ye,' gasped the
Overseer, raising himself on one arm,
and clutching at the lady's hand, which
he tried to lift to his lips.</p>

<p>'Don't say any more now,' said Madam
P&mdash;&mdash;, quietly; 'you must rest and
be quiet, or you won't get well.'</p>

<p>'Shan't I get well? Oh, I can't die&mdash;I
can't die <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">now</span>!'</p>

<p>The lady made a soothing reply, and
giving him an opiate, and arranging the
bedding so that he might rest more easily,
she left the room with me.</p>

<p>As we stepped into the hall, I saw
through the front door, which was open,
the horses harnessed in readiness for
'meeting,' and the Colonel pacing to and
fro on the piazza, smoking a cigar. He
perceived us, and halted in front of the
doorway.</p>

<p>'So, you've brought that d&mdash;&mdash; blood-thirsty
villain into my house!' he said to
Madam P&mdash;&mdash;, in a tone of strong displeasure.</p>

<p>'How could I help it? The negroes are
mad, and would kill him anywhere else,'
replied the lady, with a certain self-confidence
that showed she knew her power
over the Colonel.</p>

<p>'Why should <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">you</span> interfere between
them and him? Has he not insulted
you often enough to make you let him
alone? Can you so easily forgive his
taunting you with'&mdash;He did not finish
the sentence, but what I had learned
on the previous evening from the old
nurse gave me a clue to its meaning.
A red flame flushed the face and neck
of the octoroon woman&mdash;her eyes literally
flashed fire, and her very breath
seemed to come with pain; in a moment,
however, this emotion passed away, and
she quietly said, 'Let me settle that in
my own way. He has served <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">you</span> well&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">you</span>

have nothing against him that the
law will not punish.'</p>

<p>'By &mdash;&mdash;, you are the most unaccountable
woman I ever knew,' exclaimed the
Colonel, striding up and down the piazza,
the angry feeling passing from his face,
and giving way to a mingled expression
of wonder and admiration. The conversation
was here interrupted by Jim, who
just then made his appearance, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>'Well, Jim, what is it?' asked his
master.</p>

<p>'We'se gib'n Sam twenty lashes,
ma'am, but he beg so hard, and say he
so sorry, dat I tole him I'd ax you 'fore
we gabe him any more.'</p>

<p>'Well, if he's sorry, that's enough; but
tell him he'll get fifty another time,' said
the lady.</p>

<p>'What Sam is it?' asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>'Big Sam, the driver,' said Jim.</p>

<p>'Why was he whipped?'</p>

<p>'He told me <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">you</span> were his master, and
insisted on whipping Moye,' replied the
lady.</p>

<p>'Did he dare to do that? Give him a
hundred, Jim, not one less,' roared the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Yas, massa,' said Jim.</p>

<p>The lady looked significantly at the
negro and shook her head, but said
nothing, and he left.</p>

<p>'Come, Alice, it is nearly time for
meeting, and I want to stop and see
Sandy on the way.'</p>

<p>'I reckon I won't go,' said Madam
P&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>'You stay to take care of Moye, I suppose,'
said the Colonel, with a slight
sneer.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the lady; 'he is badly
hurt, and in danger of inflammation.'</p>

<p>'Well, suit yourself. Sir. K&mdash;&mdash;, come,
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">we'll</span> go&mdash;you'll meet some of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">natives</span>.'</p>

<p>The lady retired to the house, and the
Colonel and I were soon ready. The
driver brought the horses to the door,
and as we were about to enter the carriage,
I noticed Jim taking his accustomed
seat on the box.</p>

<p>'Who's looking after Sam?' asked the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Nobody, Cunnul; de ma'am leff him
gwo.'</p>

<p>'How dare you disobey me? Didn't
I tell you to give him a hundred?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa, but de ma'am tole me
notter.'</p>

<p>'Well, another time you mind what <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">I</span>
say&mdash;do you hear?' said his master.</p>

<p>'Yas, massa,' said the negro, with a
broad grin, 'I allers do dat.'</p>

<p>'You <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">never</span> do it, you d&mdash;&mdash; nigger;
I ought to have flogged you long ago.'</p>

<p>Jim said nothing, but gave a quiet
laugh, showing no sort of fear, and we
entered the carriage. I afterwards learned
from him that he had never been whipped,
and that all the negroes on the plantation
obeyed the lady when, which was
seldom, her orders came in conflict with
their master's. They knew if they did
not, the Colonel would whip them.</p>

<p>As we rode slowly along the Colonel
said to me, 'Well, you see that the best
people have to flog their niggers sometimes.'</p>

<p>'Yes, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">I</span> should have given that fellow
a hundred lashes, at least. I think the
effect on the others would have been
bad if Madam P&mdash;&mdash; had not had him
flogged.'</p>

<p>'But she generally goes against it. I
don't remember of her having it done in
ten years before. And yet, though I've
the worst gang of niggers in the district,
they obey her like so many children.'</p>

<p>'Why is that?'</p>

<p>'Well, there's a kind of magnetism
about her that makes everybody love
her; and then she tends them in sickness,
and is constantly doing little things
for their comfort; <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span> attaches them to
her. She is an extraordinary woman.'</p>

<p>'Whose negroes are those, Colonel?'
I asked, as, after a while, we passed a
gang of about a dozen, at work near the
roadside. Some were tending a tar-kiln,
and some engaged in cutting into fire-wood
the pines which a recent tornado
had thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>'They are mine, but they are working
now for themselves. I let such as
will, work on Sunday. I furnish the "raw
material," and pay them for what they
do, as I would a white man.'</p>

<p>'Would'nt it be better to make them
go to hear the old preacher; could'nt
they learn something from him?'</p>

<p>'Not much; Old Pomp never read
anything but the Bible, and he don't
understand that; besides, they can't be
taught. You can't make "a whistle out
of a pig's tail;" you can't make a nigger
into a white man.'</p>

<p>Just here the carriage stopped suddenly,
and we looked out to see the cause.
The road by which we had come was a
mere opening through the pines; no
fences separated it from the wooded land,
and being seldom traveled, the track
was scarcely visible. In many places it
widened to a hundred feet, but in others
tall trees had grown up on its opposite
sides, and there was scarcely width
enough for a single carriage to pass
along. In one of these narrow passages,
just before us, a queer-looking vehicle
had upset, and scattered its contents in
the road. We had no alternative but to
wait till it got out of the way; and we
all alighted to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The vehicle was a little larger than an

ordinary hand-cart, and was mounted on
wheels that had probably served their
time on a Boston dray before commencing
their travels in Secessiondom. Its
box of pine boarding and its shafts of
rough oak poles were evidently of Southern
home manufacture. Attached to it by
a rope harness, with a primitive bridle of
decidedly original construction, was&mdash;not
a horse, nor a mule, nor even an alligator,
but a 'three-year-old heifer.'</p>

<p>The wooden linch-pin of the cart had
given way, and the weight of a half-dozen
barrels of turpentine had thrown the
box off its balance, and rolled the contents
about in all directions.</p>

<p>The appearance of the proprietor of
this nondescript vehicle was in keeping
with the establishment. His coat, which
was much too short in the waist and
much too long in the skirts, was of the
common reddish gray linsey, and his
nether garments, of the same material,
stopped just below the knees. From
there downwards, he wore only the covering
that is said to have been the fashion
in Paradise before Adam took to
fig-leaves. His hat had a rim broader
than a political platform, and his skin a
color half way between that of tobacco-juice
and a tallow candle.</p>

<p>'Wal, Cunnul, how dy'ge?' said the
stranger, as we stepped from the carriage.</p>

<p>'Very well, Ned; how are you?'</p>

<p>'Purty wal, Cunnul; had the nagur
lately, right smart, but'm gittin' 'roun.'</p>

<p>'You're in a bad fix here, I see.
Can't Jim help you?'</p>

<p>'Wal, p'raps he moight. Jim, how
dy'ge?'</p>

<p>'Sort o' smart, ole feller. But come,
stir yerseff; we want ter gwo 'long,' replied
Jim, with a manifest lack of courtesy
that showed he regarded the white man
as altogether too 'trashy' to be treated
with much ceremony.</p>

<p>With the aid of Jim, a new linch-pin
was soon whittled out, the turpentine
rolled on to the cart, and the vehicle
put in a moving condition.</p>

<p>'Where are you hauling your turpentine?'

asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>'To Sam Bell's, at the "Boro'."'</p>

<p>'What will he pay you?'</p>

<p>'Wal, I've four barr'ls of "dip," and
tu of "hard." For the hull, I reckon
he'll give three dollars a barr'l.'</p>

<p>'By tale?'</p>

<p>'No, for two hun'red and eighty pound.'</p>

<p>'Well, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">I'll</span> give you two dollars and a
half by weight.'</p>

<p>'Can't take it, Cunnel; must get three
dollar.'</p>

<p>'What, will you go sixty miles with
this team, and waste five or six days, for
fifty cents on six barrels&mdash;three dollars?'</p>

<p>'Can't 'ford the time, Cunnel, but
must git three dollar a barr'l.'</p>

<p>'That fellow is a specimen of our "natives,"'
said the Colonel, as we resumed
our seats in the carriage. 'You'll see
more of them before we get back to the
plantation.'</p>

<p>'He puts a young cow to a decidedly
original use,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'Oh no, not original here; the ox and
the cow with us are both used for labor.'</p>

<p>'You don't mean to say that cows are
generally worked here?'</p>

<p>'Of course I do. Our breeds are good
for nothing as milkers, and we put them
to the next best use. I never have cow's
milk on my plantation.'</p>

<p>'You don't! why, I could have sworn
it was in my coffee this morning.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't trust you to buy brandy
for me, if your organs of taste are not
keener than that. It was goat's milk.'</p>

<p>'Then how do you get your butter?'</p>

<p>'From the North. I've had mine from
my New York factors for over two years.'</p>

<p>We soon arrived at Sandy the negro-hunter's,
and halted to allow the Colonel
to inquire as to the health of his family
of children and dogs,&mdash;the latter the
less numerous, but, if I might judge by
appearances, the more valued of the two.</p>

<h2>Southern Aids To The North.</h2>


<p>II.</p>

<p>If war did little else, it would have
its value from the fact that it acts so
extensively as an institution for the dissemination
of useful knowledge. Every
murmur of political dissension sends thousands
to consult the map, and repair their
early neglect of geography. Perhaps if
atlases and ethnographical works were
more studied we should have less war.
And it is by no means impossible that
the mutual knowledge which has been
or is to be acquired by the people of the
South and the North during this present
war will eventually aid materially in
establishing a firm bond of union.</p>

<p>That we have much to learn is shown
in the firm faith with which so many
have listened to the threats of 'a united
South.' Until recently the fierce and
furious assurances of the rebel press,
that south of Mason and Dixon's line all
were wedded heart and soul to their
cause, were taken almost without a
doubt. Who has forgotten the late
doleful convictions of the dough-faces
that the South would hold together to
the last in spite of wind or weather,
concluding invariably with the old refrain,&mdash;'Suppose
we conquer them&mdash;what
then?' Had the country at large
known in detail, as it <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">should</span> have
known from a common-school education,
what the South <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">really</span> is,&mdash;or from
experience of life what human nature
really is,&mdash;it would never have believed
that this boasted unanimity was based
on aught save ignorance or falsehood.
The Southern press itself, almost without
an exception, betrays gross ignorance of
its own country, and is very superficial
in its statistics, inclining more than any
other to warp facts and figures to suit
preconceived views. We, like it, have
tacitly adopted the belief that south of
a certain line a certain climate invariably
prevailed, and that under its influences,
from the Border to the Gulf of
Mexico, there has been developed a race
essentially alike in all its characteristics.
The planter and the slave-owner, or the
city merchant, has been the type with
which our writers have become familiar
at the hotel and the watering-place, or
in the 'store,' and we have accepted
them as speaking for the South, quite
forgetful that in America, as in other
countries, the real man of the middle
class travels but little, and when he
does, is seldom to be found mingling in
the 'higher circles.' Yet even this
Southern man of the middle class and
of 'Alleghania,' when at the North
frequently affects a 'Southern' air, which
is not more natural to him than it is to
the youthful scions of Philadelphia and
New York, who, when in Europe, so
often talk pro-slavery and bowie knife,
as though they lived in the very heart
of planterdom. But the truth is that
when we search the South out closely
we find that in reality there is a very
great difference between its districts and
their inhabitants, and, in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">fact</span>, as has
been very truly said, 'not only is there
no geographical boundary between the
free and slave States, but no moral and
intellectual boundary.'</p>

<p>In the great temperate region which,
parting from either side of the Alleghanies,
extends from Virginia to Alabama,
and is still continued in the pleasant
level of Texas, slavery has rolled
away from either mountain side like a
flood, leaving it the home of a hardy
population which regards with jealousy
and dislike both the wealthy planter
and the negro. James W. Taylor, in
his valuable collection of facts, claims
that through the whole extent of the
Southern Alleghania slavery has relatively
diminished since 1850, and that
the forthcoming census tables will establish
the assertion. 'The superintendent
of the census,' he says, 'would furnish a

document, valuable politically and for
military use, if he would anticipate the
publication of this portion of his voluminous
budget.' If government, indeed,
were to communicate to the public
what information it now holds, and has
long held, relative to the numbers and
strength of the Union men of the South,
an excitement of amazement would thrill
through the North. It was on the basis
of this knowledge that our great campaign
was planned,&mdash;and it can not be
denied that thousands of stanch Union
men were greatly astonished at the revelations
of sympathy which burst forth
most unexpectedly in districts where
the stars and stripes have been planted.
But the Cabinet 'knew what it knew'
on this subject. Much of its knowledge
never can be revealed, but enough will
come to-night to show that in our darkest
hour we had an enormous mass of aid,
little suspected by those weaker brethren
who stood aghast at the Southern bugbear,
and who, falling prostrate in nerveless
terror at the windy spectre, quaked
out repeated assurances that <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> had
no intention of 'abolitionizing the war,'

and even earnestly begged and prayed
that the emancipationists might all be
sent to Fort Warren,&mdash;so fearful were
the poor cowards lest the united South,
in the final hour of victory, might include
them in its catalogue of the doomed.
What would they say if they knew the
number and power of the ABOLITIONISTS
OF THE SOUTH,&mdash;a body of no
trifling significance, whose fierce grasp
will yet be felt on the throat of rebellion
and of slavery? It is grimly amusing
to think of the aid which the South
counted on receiving from these Northern
dough-faces,&mdash;little thinking that
within itself it contained a counter-revolutionary
party, far more dangerous
than the Northern friends were helpful.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that where
such an evil as slavery exists there will
be numbers of grave, sensible men, who,
however quiet they may keep, will have
their own opinions as to the expediency
of maintaining it. The bigots of the
South may rave of the beauty of 'the
institution,' and make many believe that
they speak for the whole,&mdash;a little scum
when whipped covers the whole pail,&mdash;but
beneath all lies a steadily-increasing
mass of practical men who would readily
enough manifest their opposition should
opportunity favor free speech. Such
people, for instance, are not insensible
to the enormously corrupting influence
of negroes on their children. Let the
reader recall Olmsted's experiences,&mdash;that,
for example, where he speaks of
three negro women who had charge of
half a dozen white girls of good family,
'from three to fifteen years of age.'</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Their language was loud and obscene, such
as I never heard before from any but the most
depraved and beastly women of the streets.
Upon observing me they dropped their voices,
but not with any appearance of shame, and
continued their altercation until their mistresses
entered. The white children, in the mean
time, had listened without any appearance of
wonder or annoyance. The moment the ladies
opened the door, they became silent.&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Cotton
Kingdom</span>, vol. i. p. 222.</p>
</div>

<p>The Southern <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Cultivator</span> for June,
1855, speaks of many young men and
women who have 'made shipwreck of all
their earthly hopes, and been led to the
fatal step by the seeds of corruption
which in the days of childhood and
youth were sown in their hearts by the
indelicate and lascivious manners and
conversation of their fathers' negroes.'
If we had no other fact or cause to cite,
this almost unnamable one might convince
the reader that there must be a
groundwork somewhere in the South
among good, moral, and decent people,
for antipathy to slavery,&mdash;human nature
teaches us as much. And such
people exist, not only among the hardy
inhabitants of the inland districts, who
are not enervated by wealth and 'exclusiveness,'

but in planterdom itself.</p>

<p>There are few in the North who realize
the number of persons in the South
who silently disapprove of slavery on
sound grounds, such as I have mentioned.
Does it seem credible that
nearly <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">ten millions</span> of people should socially
sympathize with some three hundred

thousand slave-holders, who act
with intolerable arrogance to all non-slave-holders?
'Even in those regions
where slavery is profitable,' as a writer
in the Boston <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Transcript</span> well expresses
it, 'the poor whites feel the slaveocracy
as the most grinding of aristocracies.'</p>

<div class="display">

<p>In those regions where it is not profitable,
the population regard it with a latent abhorrence,
compared with which the rhetorical and
open invectives of Garrison and Phillips are
feeble and tame. Anybody who has read Olmsted's
truthful narrative of his experience in
the slave States can not doubt this fact. The
hatred to slavery too often finds its expression
in an almost inhuman hatred of 'niggers,'
whether slave or free, but it is none the less
significant of the feelings and opinions of the
white population.</p>
</div>

<p>As I write, every fresh thunder of war
and crash of victory is followed by murmurs
of amazement at the enthusiastic
receptions which the Union forces meet
in most unexpected strongholds of the
enemy, in the very heart of slavedom.
Yet it was <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">known</span> months ago, and prophesied,
with the illustration of undeniable
facts, that this counter-revolutionary
element existed. One single truth was
forgotten,&mdash;that these Southern friends
of the Union, even while avowing that
slavery must be supported, had no love
of it in their hearts. Emancipation has
been sedulously set aside under pretence
of conciliating them; but it was needless,&mdash;'old
custom' had made them cautious,
and mindful of 'expediency;' but
the mass of them hate 'the institution.'

It is for the traitorous Northern <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">dough-faces</span>,
and the paltry handful of secessionists,
'on a thin slip of land on the
Atlantic,' that slavery is, at present,
cherished. The great area of the South
is free from it,&mdash;and ever will be.</p>

<p>It has frequently been insisted on that
the mere <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">geographical</span> obstacles to disunion
are such as to render the cause of
slavery hopeless in the long run. Yet
to this most powerful Southern aid to
the North, men seem to have been
strangely blind during the days of doubt
which so long afflicted us. These obstacles
are, briefly, the enormous growing
power of the West, and its inevitable
outlet, the Mississippi river. 'For
it is the mighty and free <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">West</span> which
will always hang like a lowering thunder-cloud
over them.'<a href="#note_14"><span class="footnoteref">14</span></a> On this subject
I quote at length from an article, in the
Danville (Ky.) <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Review</span>, by the Rev. R.
J. Breckenridge, D.D.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Whoever will look at a map of the United
States, will observe that Louisiana lies on both
sides of the Mississippi river, and that the
States of Arkansas and Mississippi lie on the
right and left banks of this great stream&mdash;eight
hundred miles of whose lower course is
thus controlled by these three States, unitedly
inhabited by hardly as many white people as
inhabit the city of New York. Observe, then,
the country drained by this river and its affluents,
commencing with Missouri on its west
bank and Kentucky on its east bank. There
are nine or ten powerful States, large portions
of three or four others, several large Territories&mdash;in
all, a country as large as all Europe,
as fine as any under the sun, already holding
many more people than all the revolted States,
and powerful regions of the earth. Does any
one suppose that these powerful States&mdash;this
great and energetic population&mdash;will ever
make a peace that will put the lower course
of this single and mighty national outlet to the
sea in the hands of a foreign government far
weaker than themselves? If there is any such
person he knows little of the past history of
mankind, and will perhaps excuse us for reminding
him that the people of Kentucky, before
they were constituted a State, gave formal
notice to the federal government, when Gen.
Washington was President, that if the United
States did not require Louisiana they would
themselves conquer it. The mouths of the
Mississippi belong, by the gift of God, to the
inhabitants of its great valley. Nothing but
irresistible force can disinherit them.</p>

<p>Try another territorial aspect of the case.
There is a bed of mountains abutting on the
left bank of the Ohio, which covers all Western
Virginia, and all Eastern Kentucky, to the
width, from east to west, in those two States,
of three or four hundred miles. These mountains,
stretching south-westwardly, pass entirely
through Tennessee, cover the back parts of
North Carolina and Georgia, heavily invade the
northern part of Alabama, and make a figure
even in the back parts of South Carolina and

the eastern parts of Mississippi, having a
course of perhaps seven or eight hundred
miles, and running far south of the northern
limit of profitable cotton culture. It is a region
of 300,000 square miles, trenching upon
eight or nine slave States, though nearly destitute
of slaves itself; trenching upon at least
five cotton States, though raising no cotton
itself. The western part of Maryland and two-thirds
of Pennsylvania are embraced in the
north-eastern continuation of this remarkable
region. Can anything that passes under the
name of statesmanship be more preposterous
than the notion of permanent peace on this
continent, founded on the abnegation of a common
and paramount government, and the idea
of the supercilious domination of the cotton
interest and the slave-trade over such a mountain
empire, so located and so peopled?</p>

<p>As a further proof of the utter impossibility
of peace except under a common government,
and at once an illustration of the import of
what has just been stated, and the suggestion
of a new and insuperable difficulty, let it be
remembered that this great mountain region,
throughout its general course, is more loyal to
the Union than any other portion of the slave
States. It is the mountain counties of Maryland
that have held treason in check in that
State; it is forty mountain counties in Western
Virginia that have laid the foundation of a new
and loyal commonwealth; it is the mountain
counties of Kentucky that first and most eagerly
took up arms for the Union; it is the mountain
region of Tennessee that alone, in that dishonored
State, furnished martyrs to the sacred
cause of freedom; it is the mountain people of
Alabama that boldly stood out against the Confederate
government till their own leaders deserted
and betrayed them.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not a strong point, but it is worth
noting, that even in South Carolina
there is an Alleghanian area of 4,074
square miles, equal to the State of Connecticut,
in which the diminished proportion
of slaves, with other local causes,
are sufficient to indicate the Union feeling
which indeed struggles there in secret.
These counties are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet it is not many months since even
this Tennessee region, it was generally
feared, would be false to the Union, on
account of its attachment to slavery.</p>

<p>The reader who has studied the facts
which I have cited, indicating the existence
of a powerful Union party at the
South (and the facts are few and weak
compared to the vast mass which exist,
and which are known to government),
may judge for himself whether that
party is Union <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">in spite of pro-slavery
principles</span>, as so many would have us believe.
Let him see where these Union
men are found, where they have come
forth with the greatest enthusiasm, and

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">then</span> say that he believes they are friends
to slavery. Let him bear in mind the
hundreds of thousands of acres, the vast
tracts, equal in extent to whole Northern
States, in the South, which are unfitted
for slave labor, and reflect whether
the inhabitants of these cool, temperate
regions are not as conscious of their inadaptability
to slave labor as he is himself;
and whether <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> are so much attached
to the institution which fosters
the Satanic pride, panders to the passions,
and corrupts the children of the
planter of the low country.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, the long-expected
declaration of President LINCOLN
has appeared in favor of adopting a plan
which may lead to the gradual abolishment
of slavery. He proposes that the
United States shall coperate with such
slave States as may desire Emancipation,
by giving such pecuniary aid as may
compensate for any losses incurred. No
interference with State rights or claims
to rights in the question is intended.</p>

<p>It is evident that this message is directed
entirely to the strengthening and
building up of the Union party of the
South, and has been based quite as much
on their demands and on a knowledge
of their needs, as on any Northern pressure.
And it will have a sure effect. It
will bring to life, if realized, those seeds
of counter-revolution which so abundantly
exist in the South. The growth may
be slow, but it will be certain. So long
as the certainty exists that compensation
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">may</span> be obtained, there will be a party
who will long for it; and where there
is a will there is a way. The executive
has finally <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">officially</span> recognized the truth
of the theory of Emancipation, and
thereby entitled itself to the honor of
having taken the greatest forward step
in the glorious path of Freedom ever
made even in our history.</p>

<h2>The Molly O'Molly Papers.</h2>

<div>
<a name="toc_22"></a>
<h3>No. I.</h3>

<p>In addressing you for the first time,
you will perhaps expect me to give some
account of myself and my ancestry, as
did the illustrious <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Spectator</span>.</p>

<p>My remote ancestors are Irish. From
them I inherited enthusiasm, a gun-powder
temper, a propensity to blunder, and
a name&mdash;Molly O'Molly. The origin
of this name I have in vain endeavored
to trace in history, perhaps because it
belonged to a very old family, one of
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">prehistorics</span>. As such it might have
been that of a demigod, or, according to
the development theory, of a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">demi-man</span>.
Or it might have been that of an old
Irish gentleman, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">gentle</span> in truth;&mdash;in
the formative stage of society it is the
monster that leaves traces of himself, as
in an old geologic period the huge reptile
left his tracks in the plastic earth,
which afterward hardened into rock.</p>


<p>Then, too, I have searched in vain for
anything like it in ancient Irish poetry,
thinking that my progenitor's name
might have been therein embalmed.

'The stony science'&mdash;mind you&mdash;reveals
to us the former existence of the
huge reptile, the fragmentary, mighty
mastodon, and, imperfect, the mail-clad
fish. But, wonder of wonders, we find
the whole <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">insect</span> preserved in that fossil
gum amber. And even so in verse,
characters are preserved for all time,
that could not make their mark in history,
and that had none of the elements
of an earthly immortality. Did I wish
immortality I would choose a poet for
my friend;&mdash;an <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">In Memoriam</span> is worth
all the records of the dry chronicler.</p>

<p>But, it is not with the root of the family
tree that you have to do, but with the
twig Myself.</p>

<p>As for my physique,&mdash;I am not like
the scripture personage who beheld his
face in a glass, and straightway forgot
what manner of man he was. I have,
on the contrary, a very distinct recollection
of my face; suffice it to say, that,
had I Rafaelle's pencil, I would not, like
him, employ it on my own portrait.</p>

<p>And my life&mdash;the circumstances
which have influenced, or rather created
its currents, have been trifling; not
that it has had no powerful currents;
it is said that the equilibrium of the
whole ocean could be destroyed by a
single mollusk or coralline,&mdash;but my life
has been an uneventful one. I never
met with an adventure, never even had
a hair-breadth escape,&mdash;yes, I did, too,
have one hair-breadth escape. I once
just grazed matrimony. The truth is, I
fell in love, and was sinking with Falstaff's
'alacrity,' when I was fished out;
but somehow I slipt off the hook&mdash;fortunately,
however, was left on shore.
By the way, the best way to get out of
love is to be drawn out by the matrimonial
hook. One of Holmes' characters
wished to change a vowel of the verb <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">to
love</span>, and conjugate it&mdash;I have forgotten
how far. Where two set out to
conjugate together the verb to love in
the first person plural, it is well if they
do not, before the honey-moon is over,
get to the present-perfect, indicative.
Alas! I have thus far, in the first person
singular, conjugated too many verbs,
among them <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">to enjoy</span>. As for <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">to be</span>, I
have come to the balancing in my mind
of the question that so perplexed Hamlet&mdash;'To
be, or not to be.' For, with
all the natural cheerfulness of my disposition,
I can not help sometimes looking
on the dark side of life. But there is no
use in setting down my gloomy reflections,&mdash;all
have them. We are all surrounded
by an atmosphere of misery,
pressing on us fifteen pounds to the
square inch, so evenly and constantly
that we know not its fearful weight.
To change the figure. Have you ever
thought how much misery one life <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">can</span>

hold in solution? Each year, as it flows
into it, adds to it a heaviness, a weight
of woe, as the rivers add salts to the
ocean. I do not refer to the most unhappy,
but to all. Some one says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'If singing breath, if echoing chord</p>
<p class="l">To every hidden pang were given,</p>
<p class="l">What endless melodies were poured,</p>
<p class="l">As sad as earth, as sweet as heaven.'</p>
</div>

<p>If breath to every hidden prayer were
given, could it be <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">singing</span> breath? Would
it not be a wail monotonous as the dirge
of the November wind over the dead
summer, a wail for lost hopes, lost joys,
lost loves? Or the monotony would be
varied&mdash;as is the wind by fitful gusts&mdash;by
shrieks of despair, cries of agony.
No, no, there is no use in trying to modulate
our woes,&mdash;'we're all wrong,&mdash;the

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">time</span> in us is lost.'</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Henceforth I'll bear</p>
<p class="l">Affliction, till it do cry out itself,</p>
<p class="l">"Enough, enough," and die.'</p>
</div>

<p>But why talk thus? why mourn over
dead hopes, dead joys, dead loves? 'Tis
best to bury the dead out of our sight,
and from them will spring many humbler
hopes, quieter joys, more lowly affections,
which 'smell sweet' though they

'blossom in the dust,' and they are the
only resurrection these dead ones can
ever have. I have been reading, in
Maury's Geography of the Sea, how the
sea's dead are preserved; how they stand

like enchanted warders of the treasures
of the deep, unchanged, except that the
expression of life is exchanged for the
ghastliness of death. So, down beneath
the surface currents do some deep souls
preserve their dead hopes, joys, loves.
Oh, this is unwise; this is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> as God
intended; for, unlike the sea's dead,
there will be for these no resurrection.</p>

<p>Thus far I wrote, when the current
of my thoughts was changed by a lively
tune struck up by a hand-organ across
the street. I am not 'good' at distinguishing
tunes, but this one I had so often
heard in childhood, and had so wondered
at its strange title, that I could
but remember it. It was 'The Devil's
Dream.' Were I a poet, I would write
the words to it;&mdash;but then, too, I would
need be a musician to compose a suitable
new tune to the words! The rattling,
reckless notes should be varied by
those sad enough to make an unlost angel
weep&mdash;an unlost angel, for, to the hot
eyes of the lost, no tears can come. 'The

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Devil's</span> Dream'&mdash;perhaps it is of Heaven.
Doubtless, frescoed in heavenly colors
on the walls of his memory, are scenes
from which fancy has but to brush the
smoke and grime of perdition to restore
them to almost their original beauty. I
could even pity the 'Father of lies,' the
'Essence of evil,' the 'Enemy of mankind,'
when I think of the terrible awaking.
But does <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">he</span> ever sleep? Has
there since the fall been a pause in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">his</span>

labors? Perhaps the reason this tune-time
is so fast is because he is dreaming
in a hurry,&mdash;must soon be up and doing.
But it is my opinion that he has so
wound up the world to wickedness, that
he might sleep a hundred years, and it
would have scarcely begun to run down
on his awaking; when, from the familiar
appearance of all things, he would
swear 'it was but an after-dinner nap.'
Indeed he might die, might to-day go
out in utter nothingness like a falling
star, and it would be away in the year
two thousand before he would be missed,&mdash;we
have learned to do our own devil-work
so rarely. Meanwhile the well-wound
world&mdash;as a music-box plays
over the same tunes&mdash;would go on sinning
over the same old sins. Satan is a
great economist, but a paltry deviser,&mdash;he
has not invented a new sin since the
flood. My thoughts thus danced along
to the music, when they were brought
to a dead stop by its cessation; and it
was time, you will think....</p>

<p>But, permit me to remind you that
my name is not <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">acquired</span>, but <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">inherited</span>.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">At your service,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">MOLLY O'MOLLY.</p>

<a name="toc_23"></a>
<h3>No. II.</h3>

<p>I detest that man who bides his time
to repay a wrong or fancied wrong, who
keeps alive in his hardened nature the
vile thing hatred, and would for centuries,
did he live thus long,&mdash;as the toad
is kept alive in the solid rock. Hugh
Miller says he is 'disposed to regard the
poison bag of the serpent as a mark of
degradation;' this venomous spite is
certainly a mark of degradation, and it
is only creeping, crawling souls that
have it, but the creeping and crawling
are a part of the curse.</p>

<p>Yet I have a respect for honest
indignation, righteous anger, such as the
O'Mollys have ever been capable of.
And all the O'Molly blood in my veins
has been stirred by the contemptuous
manner in which some men have spoken
of woman. 'Weak woman,&mdash;inconstant
woman;' they have made the wind a
type of her fickleness. In this they are
right; for it has been proved that the
seasons in their return, day and night,
are not more sure than the wind. Such
fickleness as this is preferable to <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">man's</span>
greatest constancy. Woman weak! she's
gentle as the summer breeze, I grant;&mdash;but,
like this same breeze, when she's
roused&mdash;then beware! You have doubtless
heard of that gale that forced back
the Gulf Stream, and piled it up thirty
feet at its source.</p>

<p>Take care how you sour woman's
nature,&mdash;remember that, once soured, all
the honey in the universe will not
sweeten it. There is such a thing as
making vinegar of molasses, but I never
heard of making molasses of vinegar.

Do you wish to know the turning process?
Grumbling&mdash;everlasting fault-finding&mdash;at
breakfast, dinner, and supper,
the same old tune. I don't see how
the man who boards can endure it; he is
obliged to swallow his food without complaint.
The landlady at the head of
the table is a very different-looking
individual from the meek woman he
afterwards calls wife,&mdash;not a word can he
say, though he morning after morning,
in his breakfast, recognizes, through its
various disguises, yesterday's dinner. By
the way, this is after Dame Nature's
plan; she uses the greatest economy in
feeding her immense family of boarders;
never wastes a refuse scrap, or even a
drop of water. If one of these boarders
dies, it is true he is not, like 'the poor
work-house boy,' served up as one dish,
but he becomes an ingredient in many
'a dainty dish' fit to 'to set before a
king.' But I am not, like 'Miss
Ophelia' in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' going to
explore the good dame's kitchen,&mdash;will
rather eat what is set before me, asking
no questions; which last, what <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">man</span> ever
did, if he could help it?</p>

<p>For an insignificant man, originally
but a cipher, who owes it to his wife
that he is even the fraction that he is, to
talk about 'woman knowing her place&mdash;he's
head,' etc.! If he had given her the
place that belonged to her, their value,
not as individual figures, but as one
number, would have been increased a
thousand fold. I have made a calculation,
and this is literally true, or rather,
you will say, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">figuratively</span> true. Well,
this kind of figures can not lie.</p>

<p>'The rose,' the Burmese say, 'imparts
fragrance to the leaf in which it is folded.'

Many a man has had a sweetness
imparted to his character by the woman
he has sheltered in his bosom&mdash;though
some characters 'not all the perfume
of Arabia could sweeten;' and,
strange as it seem, most women would
rather be folded in a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">tobacco</span> leaf than
'waste their sweetness on desert air.'
Though it is a long time since I have
been a man <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">lover</span>, I am not a man <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">hater</span>.
I can not hate anything that has been
so hallowed by woman's love,&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">its</span> magnetism
gives a sort of attractive power
to him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been
said about woman's weakness, it is acknowledged
that she has a pretty strong
will of her own. Well, we need a strong
will,&mdash;it is the great <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">centrifugal force</span>
that God has given to all. Only it must
be subordinate to the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">centripetal force</span>
of the universe&mdash;the Divine will.</p>

<p>It is said that the centripetal force of
our solar system is the Pleiad Alcyon. I
know not whether the other stars of that
cluster feel this attraction; if they do,
what a centrifugal force the lost Pleiad
must have had, to break away from
'the sweet influences' which, through so
immense a distance, draw the sun with
all his train. This is not without a parallel&mdash;when

'the morning stars sang
together' over the new-born earth, one
'star of the morning' was not there to
join in the chorus.</p>

<p>But Old Sol will probably never so
strongly assert <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">his</span> centrifugality as to
set such an example of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">secession</span> to his
planets and comets.</p>

<p>Pardon this astronomical digression.
I have just returned from hearing an itinerant
lecturer, and it will take a week
to get the smoke of his magic lantern
out of my eyes. If there is any error in
these observations, blame the itinerant,
not me.</p>

<p>I had been low-spirited all day, had
tried reading, work,&mdash;all of no avail.
Dyspeptic views of life would present
themselves to my mind. Some natures,
and mine is of them, like the pendulum,
need a weight attached to them to keep
them from going too fast. But a wholesome
sorrow is very different from this
moping melancholy, when the thoughts
run in one direction, till they almost
wear a channel for themselves&mdash;when
the channel is worn, there is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">insanity</span>.</p>

<p>Neither are my gloomy religious views
to-day those that will regenerate the
world. Those lines of Dr. Watts,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'We should suspect some danger nigh</p>
<p class="l">When we possess delight,'&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>it is said, were written after a disappointment

in love&mdash;it was 'sour grapes'
that morning&mdash;with the grave divine.</p>

<p>As a general rule, where we possess
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">continued</span> delight, there is no 'danger
nigh.' Where an enjoyment comes between
us and our God, it casts on us a
shadow. When we have plucked a
beautiful flower, if poisonous, it has
such a sickening odor that we fling it
from us. We do not 'pay too dear for
our whistle,' unless it costs us a sin; then
it soon becomes a loathed and useless
toy. Otherwise, the dearer we pay, the
sweeter its music.</p>

<p>And even if there is 'danger nigh'&mdash;because
we are pleased with the beautiful
foam, need we steer straight for the
breakers? Not every tempting morsel
is the enemy's bait, though we should
be careful how we nibble;&mdash;he is no
blunderer (a proof positive that he is
not Irish), never leaves his trap sprung&mdash;and
we may get caught.</p>

<p>This is a synopsis of the arguments,
or rather assertions, with which I opposed
those of the blues; but, finding
they were getting the better of me, I
started out for a walk. It was a chilly
afternoon; the whole sky, except a clear
place just above the western horizon,
was covered with those heavy, diluted
India-ink clouds; the setting sun throwing
a dreary red light on the northern
and eastern mountains, adding sullenness
to the gloom, instead of dispelling
it. But why describe this gloomy sunset,
there are so many beautiful ones?&mdash;when,
as the grand, old, dying Humboldt
said, the 'glorious rays seem to
beckon earth to heaven?'</p>

<p>Well, I walked so fast that I left my
blue tormentors far in the rear. On
the way I met a friend, who invited me
to go to the astronomical lecture. Here
you have it, after many digressions. My
thoughts never strike a plane surface,
but always a spherical, and fly off in a
tangent.</p>

<p>Sydney Smith says, 'Remember the
flood and be brief.' You know I belong
to a very old family; and from an ancestor,
who lived before the flood, has
been transmitted through a long line of
O'Mollys a disposition to spin out. Unfortunately
an antediluvian length of
time was not an <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">heir-loom</span> to</p>

<h2>Sketches Of Edinburgh Literati.</h2>

<p>By A Former Member Of Its Press.</p>


<p>There was a time when the little
hamlet of Cockpaine, ten miles from
Edinburgh, in addition to the charms of
its scenery, was also socially attractive
from the high literary talent of several
of its residents. It was situated on the
banks of the Esk, whose rapid flow affords
a valuable water-power. This had
been improved under the enterprise of
Mr. Craig, an extensive manufacturer,
who became at last proprietor not only
of the mills, but of the entire village.
Mr. Craig was successful for several
years; but the revulsions of trade during
the Crimean war swept away his
previous profits, and in 1854 he sank
in utter bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The extensive domain of the Earl of
Dalhousie lay next to Cockpaine, and
the village site seemed all that was
necessary to its completeness. As soon
as the latter was offered for sale, the
earl made the long-desired purchase,
and then began the immediate eviction
of its population. I saw four hundred
operatives, of all ages, driven off on one

sad occasion&mdash;a scene which reminded
me most painfully of Goldsmith's lines in
the 'Deserted Village:'&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day</p>
<p class="l">That called them from their native walks away,</p>
<p class="l">When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,</p>
<p class="l">Hung round the bowers, and fondly looked their last,</p>
<p class="l">And took a long farewell, and wished in vain</p>

<p class="l">For seats like these beyond the western main;</p>
<p class="l">And shuddering still to face the distant deep,</p>
<p class="l">Returned and wept, and still returned to weep.'</p>
</div>

<p>A subsequent visit to what was once
the thriving village, with its embowered
cottages reflected from the waters of the
Esk, its groups of romping children, its
Sabbath melodies and its secular din,
now changed to a nobleman's preserves,
recalled the following truthful sketch
from the same poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Thus fares the land by luxury betrayed,</p>
<p class="l">In Nature's simplest charms arrayed;</p>

<p class="l">But verging to decline, its splendors rise,</p>
<p class="l">Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;</p>
<p class="l">While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,</p>
<p class="l">The mournful peasant leads his humble band;</p>
<p class="l">And while he sinks, without one arm to save,</p>
<p class="l"><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">The country blooms, a garden and a grave.</span>'</p>
</div>

<p>Among those whom Mr. Craig had
numbered with the friends of his better
days, the first rank might have been
conceded to that most eccentric and interesting
child of genius, Thomas DeQuincey.</p>

<p>Mr. Craig had thrown open to his use
a lovely cottage and grounds, commonly
known as 'the Paddock,' which DeQuincey
and his family occupied for several
years as privileged guests. 'The Opium-eater,'
as he was universally called by
the villagers, was not more remarkable
in character than in appearance. His
attenuated form, though but five feet six
in height, seemed singularly tall; and
his sharply aquiline countenance was
strongly indicative of reflection. This
aspect was increased by a downward
cast of the eyes, which were invariably
fixed upon the ground; and in his solitary
walks he seemed like one rapt in
a dream. Such a character could not
but be quite a marvel to the literary
coterie of Cockpaine, which found in
him an inexhaustible subject of discussion;
while the more common class of
the community viewed him with solemn
wonderment&mdash;'aye, there he gaes aff
to th' brae&mdash;he'll kill himsell wi' ower
thinkin'&mdash;glowrin all the day lang&mdash;ah,
there's na gude in that black stuff;
it's worse nor whiskey and baccy forbye.'

Such were some of the ordinary
comments on the weird form which was
seen emerging from 'the Paddock' and
moving in solitude towards the hills.
Taciturnity was a striking feature in DeQuincey's
character, and was, no doubt,
owing to intense mental action. The
inner life, aroused to extreme activity
by continued stimulus, excluded all perceptions
beyond its own limits, and the
world in which he dwelt was sufficiently
large without the intrusion of external
things. In his walks I would often
follow in his track, with that fondness
of imitation peculiar to childhood, but
was never the object of his notice, and
never heard him converse but once.
Overcome by such recluse habits, DeQuincey
showed no desire to court the
patronage of the great, and had but little
intercourse with the lordly family of
the Dalhousies. Indeed, his only intimacy
was with Mr. Craig, whose hospitality
had won his heart. He was at
this time still consuming enormous quantities
of opium, having never abated its
use, notwithstanding his allusions to reform
in the 'Confessions.' His two
daughters, like those of Milton, cheered
the domestic scenes of 'the Paddock,'
and the trio formed a circle whose interest
pervaded the literary world.</p>

<p>DeQuincey was at that time writing
for Hogg's <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Instructor</span>, a popular Edinburgh
periodical, in which his articles
were a leading attraction. The <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Instructor</span>

was published weekly, and in
addition to the pen of the 'Opium-eater,'
could boast the editorship of the brilliant
George Gilfillan. The former of
these devoted himself to a series of
interesting miscellanies, in which he
brought out many pen-and-ink portraits
of striking power. At times, indeed, he
was almost considered joint editor; but
his use of opium was so little abated,

that it forbade dependence upon his
pen. The quantity of the drug consumed
by him, according to report, was
astonishing. In his daily walk along
the Esk, his form was easily distinguished,
even at a distance, by the
prim black surtout, whose priestly aspect
was somewhat in contrast with his
'shocking-bad' hat. DeQuincey had by
this time escaped from the poverty of
his early days, of which he speaks so
bitterly in his 'Confessions,' and was, if
not a man of wealth, at least in easy
circumstances. He was reputed to own
a snug little estate, called 'Lasswade;'
but he abandoned it to a tenant, and
gave preference to Cockpaine, which
charmed him by its romantic scenery.
His pay for contributions to the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Instructor</span>
could not have been less than
a guinea per page; and Hogg, its publisher
(who was no relation to the Ettrick
shepherd), would have given him
more had it been demanded. The <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Instructor</span>

was subsequently merged into
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Titan</span>, and its place of publication
changed to London.</p>

<p>Removing from Cockpaine, my initiation
into Edinburgh life was through an
acquaintance with the noted publishing
house of the Messrs. Black, who were
then getting out their splendid edition
of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Encyclopedia Brittanica</span>.</p>

<p>This vast enterprise, which cost
25,000, was highly profitable, through
the energy and cleverness of Robert
Black, who conducted it. Among other
distinguished contributors, I frequently
met in its office Mr., subsequently Lord,
Macaulay, who furnished the articles
on 'Pitt,' 'Canning,' and other distinguished
statesmen. Although at that
time a man of slender means, Mr. Macaulay
refused compensation for these
papers, on the score of strong personal
friendship. However, he received an
indirect reward, more valuable than
mere gold, since Robert Black was his
strong political supporter, and frequently
presided at public meetings held to
further Macaulay's interests. I have
often seen Music Hall crowded by an
enthusiastic mass while the bookseller
filled the chair, and the great reviewer
appeared as a public orator. Macaulay's
person was very striking and impressive.
He was tall, and of noble
build and full development. Although
one of the most diligent of readers and
hard working of students of any age,
his ruddy countenance did not indicate
close application, and his appearance
was anything but that of a book-worm.
Indeed, at first glance, one would have
taken him for a fine specimen of the
wealthy English farmer; and to have
observed his habits of good living at
the social dining parties, would have
added to the impression that in him
the animal nature was far in advance
of the intellectual. Macaulay, on all
festive occasions, proved himself as elegant
a conversationist as he was a writer;
his tone was thoroughly English,
and his pronunciation, like that of
Washington Irving, was singularly correct.
As a speaker, he at times rose to
splendid flights of oratory, although his
delivery from memory was less effective
than the extemporaneous style. Macaulay
never married, but was always
happy in the social circle of his friends.</p>

<p>The Blacks were likewise publishers
of Scott's novels, the demand for which
was so great that they were seldom 'off
the press.' Three standard editions were
issued,&mdash;one of forty-eight volumes, at
a low rate, another of twenty-five volumes,
at higher cost, and an additional
library edition, of still greater price.
Of these, one thousand 'sets' per year
were the average of sale.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, I was in connection
with the Ballantynes, who published
Blackwood's Magazine, one of the most
profitable periodicals in the United
Kingdom. This connection led to an
acquaintance with John Wilson, better
known as 'Christopher North,' of 'Old
Ebony.' When the printers were in
haste, I have frequently walked down
to his residence in Gloucester Place,
and sat by his side, waiting patiently,
hour after hour, for copy. The professor
always wrote in the night, and would
frequently dash off one of his splendid

articles between supper and daybreak.
His study was a small room, containing
a table littered with paper, the walls
garnished with a few pictures, while
heaps of books were scattered wherever
chance might direct. At this table
might have been seen the famous
professor of moral philosophy, stripped
to his shirt and pantaloons, the former
open in front, and displaying a vast, hirsute
chest, while a slovenly necktie kept
the limp collar from utter loss of place.
This was his favorite state for composition,
and was in true keeping with the
character and productions of his genius.
When in public, the professor was still a
sloven; but his heavy form and majestic
head and countenance&mdash;though he was
not a tall man&mdash;at once commanded
respect. He never appeared anything
but the philosopher, and I, who saw him
in the dishabille of his study, never lost
my awe for his greatness. He had a
worthy family, and maintained an excellent
establishment. Aytoun, who is
now editor of Blackwood, married one
of his daughters, and has proved, by his
stirring ballads, that he was worthy of
such an alliance. In writing, the professor
eschewed gas light, and made use
of the more classic lamp. A bottle of
wine was his companion, and stood at
his elbow until exhausted. This will
perhaps explain much of the convivial
character of the 'Notes.' The old-fashioned
quill pen was his preference; and
as the hours advanced, and mental excitement
waxed in activity, the profuse
spattering of ink rattled like rain. As
a matter of course, his pay was of the
highest rate, and his articles were read
with avidity. One reason of this may
be found in the boldness with which he
drags into the imaginary colloquies of

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Noctes Ambrosian</span> the literati of both
kingdoms. This liberty was sometimes
felt keenly, and sharply resented. Poor
James Hogg, the 'Ettrick Shepherd,'
who was just then getting a position in
the literary world, sometimes found himself
figuring unexpectedly in the scenes,
as the victim of relentless wit. As a
retaliation, Hogg attacked Wilson in a
sheet which he was then publishing in
the Cowgate, under the aid and patronage
of a hatter.</p>

<p>It was one of John Wilson's fancies
to affect a love of boxing, and it was a
favorite theme in the 'Ambrosial Discussions.'
From this some have imagined
that he was of a pugilistic turn,
whereas he knew nothing of the 'science,'
and only affected the knowledge
in jest.</p>

<p>Next to old 'Kit North,' the most
truly beloved contributor to Blackwood
was 'Delta,' whose poetry was for years
expected, almost of course, in every
number. As Wilson's identity was well-nigh
lost in his imaginary character, so
plain Dr. Moir was, in the literary
world, merged in 'Delta' of Blackwood.
But to the inhabitants of Musselburg he
sustained a character altogether different,
and the gentle <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Delta</span> was only
known as one worthy of the title of
'the good physician.' I lived at Musselburg
two years, and had ample opportunities
of personal acquaintance.
Dr. Moir was a man of highly benevolent
countenance, and of quiet and retiring
manners. His practice was very
extensive, and at almost all hours he
could have been seen driving an old
gray horse through the streets and suburbs
of the town. The ancient character
of Musselburg seemed to have been
as congenial to his temperament as
Nuremberg was to that of Hans Sachs.
Indeed, in antiquity it can glory over

'Auld Reekie,' according to the quaint
couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Musselboro' was a boro' when Edinburgh was nane;</p>
<p class="l">Musselboro'll be a boro' when Edinburgh is gane.'</p>

</div>

<p>Moir was buried at Inveresk, where
his remains are honored by a noble
monument; the memory of his genius
will be cherished by all readers of Blackwood.
He died in 1854.</p>

<p>While engaged on the Encyclopedia
to which we have made reference, I
made the acquaintance of McCulloch,
the distinguished writer of finances, who
furnished the article on 'Banking.'</p>


<p>However distinguished may have been
the position of this man in point of talent,
he failed utterly to command respect;
and I chiefly remember his coarse,
overbearing tone of boastful superiority,
and his abusive language to the compositors
who set up his MSS. That they
found the latter difficult of deciphering
is not surprising, since the sheet looked
less like human calligraphy than a row
of bayonets. McCulloch had edited the
'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Scotsman</span>' with decided ability, and
having attracted the attention of Lord
Brougham, had received an appointment
in the stationer's office. But in
his promotion he quickly forgot his humble
origin, and displayed his native vulgarity
by lording it over the craftsmen
who gave form and life to his thoughts.</p>

<p>Among the giants of Scotland at that
time, Thomas Chalmers ranked chief,
and the death of Sir Walter Scott had
left him without a peer. I used to meet
him as he took his early walks, and in
his loving way of greeting youth he often
bade me a cheerful good-morning. He
was then living at Kinghorn, about eight
miles from Edinburgh. Dr. Chalmers'
robust stature was in keeping with the
power of his intellect. He was of massive
frame, and displayed a breadth of
shoulder which seemed borrowed from
the Farnese Hercules. Though so distinguished
as a divine, there was nothing
clerical in his appearance&mdash;nothing of
that air of 'the cloth' which at once
proclaims the preacher. His noble features
were generally overspread with a
benevolent smile, which seemed to shed
an illumination as though from the ignition
of the soul; while at other times he
was possessed with a spirit of abstraction
as if walking in a dream.</p>

<p>As a theologian, Chalmers was great
beyond any of his contemporaries; and
yet, strictly speaking, his genius was
mathematical, rather than theological.
In this respect he resembled that famed
American of whom he professed himself
a disciple&mdash;Jonathan Edwards. Of the
latter it is stated by no less a critic than
the author of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Eclipse of Faith</span> (Henry
Rogers), that he was born a mathematician.
Chalmers, however, was a
master of all science, and it would have
been difficult for even a specialist to
have taken him at an advantage. As
greatness is always set off by simplicity,
the latter feature was one of the chief
beauties in what we may call the Chalmerian
Colossus. I have often seen him
leaning upon the half open door of a
smithy, conversing with the intelligent
workmen, as they rested from the use
of the sledge. Having referred to his
love of children, I may add, in respect
to myself, that when I, in my childhood,
spoke to him in the street, I was generally
favored with an apple. He was
indeed an ardent lover of the young,
and his genius seemed to gather freshness
from his intercourse with childhood.</p>

<p>Edinburgh will not soon forget his interest
in the welfare of the poor, in
which he has been so ably seconded by
the present Dr. Guthrie. I well remember
beholding the two Christian reformers,
standing above the slums of the
city, contemplating the fields which the
latter had assumed. Suddenly Chalmers
clapped his friend upon the back,
and exclaimed, in rude pleasantry,

'Wow, Tummus Guthrie, but ye ha a
bonnie parish.' Chalmers' pronunciation
was singularly broad, and not easily
understood by many. Stopping once,
during a tour in England, at a place
where there was a seminary, a gentleman
inquired of him how many Scotch
boys were in attendance. 'Saxtain or
savantain,' was the reply. 'Enough,'
says the gentleman, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">sotto voce</span>, to corrupt
a whole school.' As regards calligraphy,
Chalmers wrote the most illegible
hand in Scotland. He could not
even read it himself, and was frequently
obliged to call his wife and daughters to
his aid. Many of his discourses, when
intended for the press, were copied by
them. His manuscript, when fresh from
his hand, looked as though a fly had fallen
into the ink-stand, and then crawled
over the page. When his letters were
received at his paternal home, the language
of the father was, 'A letter from
Tummus, eh; weel, when he comes

hame, he maun read it himsel.' There
was something Homeric in Chalmers'

mind; and Hugh Miller always considered
him the bard of the Free Church,
as well as its great theologian and still
greater benefactor; and this, too, notwithstanding
the fact that he never
wrote a line of verse in his life. The
simplest truths, when announced by him,
took a poetic shape, and moved along
with all the majesty of his towering genius.
Speaking of Hugh Miller brings
him before us at the time that he was
writing for the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Caledonia Mercury</span>. He
was then editor of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">The Witness</span>, but gave
to the former paper such moments as he
could abstract from his more serious
duties. His department in the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Mercury</span>
was the reviewing new publications.
Besides his engagement with
these two journals, he was pursuing
those studies which made him the prince
of British geologists. Geology was his
passion. Indeed, while writing leaders
for the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Witness</span>, or turning over the
leaves of hot-pressed volumes, his mind
was wandering among such scenes as
the 'Lake of Stromness,' and the 'Old
Red Sandstone' of his native Cromarty.
His geological sketches in the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Witness</span>

were a new feature in journalism,
and formed the basis of that work
which so admirably refuted the 'Vestiges
of Creation.' I met Miller daily
for several years. He was tall, and of
a well-built and massive frame, and evidently
capable of great endurance, both
of mind and body. Considered as one
of the distinguished instances of self-made
men, Hugh Miller finds his only
parallel in Horace Greeley, although the
path to greatness was in the first instance
even more laborious than in the
latter. Let any one read Miller's experiences
and adventures, as described in
'My Schools and my Schoolmasters,'
and he will find a renewed suggestion
of the thought which Johnson so pathetically
breathes in his 'London:'&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'The mournful truth is everywhere confessed,</p>
<p class="l">Slow rises worth by poverty depressed.'</p>
</div>

<p>Miller's appearance, when in trim attire,
was that of the Scottish 'Dominie,'
or parish schoolmaster; but, like the
great American editor, he was exceedingly
slovenly, both by nature and by
long habits of carelessness. When in
the street, he always wore the plaid,
although that garment was quite out of
use, and indicated at once something
quaint or rustic in the wearer. At this
time Miller was living in one of the
suburbs of Edinburgh, called Porto Bello.
When we exchanged greetings in
the street, his countenance, usually overcast
with the pale hue of thought, would
light up with a bright and open smile,
which continued as long as he was
speaking, but soon yielded to returning
abstraction. One of the most beautiful
sights I have ever seen was the groups
of youth whom Miller used to invite
as companions of an afternoon walk.
None were forbidden on the score of
childhood, and many a 'wee bairn' trotted
after the larger lads who accompanied
'the gude stane-cracker,' and 'the
bonnie mon what gaes amang the rocks.'
He might well be called the 'stane-cracker,'

since I have seen him on Calton Hill,
or Arthur's Seat, or among the crags,
lecturing, in a calm, quiet tone, on the
mysteries which his hammer had brought
to light. These were the only recreations
of one whose days and nights were,
with the exception of a brief and often
wakeful season of rest, given to laborious
study. Had he indulged more freely
in them, he might have escaped the
terrible fate which overtook him. But
he never could emancipate himself from
the labor to which he was chained. His
'Impressions of England,' which is one
of the most delightful of his books, was
the product of a subsequent tour for
health. If such were his recreations,
what must have been his labors? Miller's
domestic life did much to cheer an
over-worked system. He gives, in the
'Schools and Schoolmasters,' a pleasing
allusion to the fascination of his courtship;
and his subsequent life was graced
by one whoso appearance, as I remember
her, was singularly lovely and interesting.
In his home circle, Miller was
truly a happy man. I may remark, in

passing, that this is a feature in Scottish
genius. While Shelley, Byron, Bulwer,
Dickens, and other English authors,
have been wrecked by home difficulties,
Scott, Chalmers, Miller, Wilson, and the
whole line of Scottish authors, drank
deep of domestic felicity. Perhaps this
may be explained by the contrast between
the warmth of Scottish character,
and the saturnine and unsocial disposition
of the English. Edinburgh could at
that time boast of two distinguished men
of the name of Miller; and the great geologist
had almost his fellow in the professor
of surgery. The two were very
intimate, and the one found in the other
not only a friend, but a faithful medical
adviser. Professor Miller was then printing
his leading work, and I had frequent
occasion to visit him with reference to
its publication. One morning, as I rang,
the professor came to the door with a
hurried and nervous step. As it opened,
I noted that his tall form was peculiarly
agitated, and his countenance was deadly
pale. In a calm, subdued voice, he
informed me that Hugh Miller had just
committed suicide with a pistol. The
terrible news overcame me with a shudder,
and I almost sank to the floor. The
fact was not yet generally known; and
oh, when it should be made public, what
a blow would be felt by the moral and
scientific world! The professor knew
that the affair might possibly be ascribed
by some to accident, but he at once referred
it to insanity. The over-worked
brain of the geologist had been for some
time threatened with a collapse. He
had, in addition to the management of
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Witness</span>, been elaborating a work of
deep and exhausting character, and the
mental excitement which accompanied
its completion was like devouring fire.
I have frequently gone to his room at a
late hour of the night, and found him
sitting before the smouldering grate, so
absorbed in thought that, as he balanced
the probabilities of contending theories,
he unwittingly accompanied the mental
effort by balancing the poker on the
bar. I have seen, on such an occasion,
a greasy stream oozing from the pocket
of his fustian coat, and supplied by the
roll of butter which at morning market
he had purchased for home use. On the
table lay his MSS., so marred with interlinings
and corrections, that, notwithstanding
his neat and delicate hand, it
was almost a complete blot. These habits
could not but terminate in utter
wreck, and I have ever coincided with
the professor's opinion as to the cause
of his death. This gentleman stated to
me a fact not generally known, that a
few days before the awful catastrophe,
the unfortunate man called on him in
great distress, and sought his advice.
He complained of a pain in his head,
and then added an expression of fears
with regard to that which was to him
of untold value. This was his mineral
and geological collection in Shrub Place,
which was, no doubt, the most valuable
private one in the kingdom. He was
haunted by apprehension of its robbery
by a gang of thieves, and asked what
measures of safety would be advisable.
The professor endeavored to expel the
absurd idea by playful remark, and supposed
himself somewhat successful. The
next thing he heard was the intelligence
of his death. It is quite evident that
the fatal revolver was purchased for
the defense of his treasures. What a
lesson is this of the danger of excessive
application, of unreasonable toil, of late
hours, and mental tension. A continued
exhaustion of his energies had brought
upon the geologist a state of mental horror
from which death seemed the only
relief. The reaction of the nervous system
was, no doubt, similar to that arising
from delirium tremens; and thus extremes
met, and the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">savant</span> perished like
the inebriate.</p>

<p>The tragedy did not seem complete until
another victim should be added. The
professor took the revolver to Thompson's,
on Leith Walk, in order to learn
by examination how many shots had
been fired by the unfortunate suicide.
The gunsmith took the weapon, but handled
it so carelessly, that it went off in
his hands, and the ball caused his death.</p>

<p>Speaking of excessive labor, we may

observe that this is the general rule among
men of science or letters. They are, as
a class, crushed by engagements and duties,
as well as by problems and questions
of which the world can not even dream.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh literati know but little
of rest or recreation; from the editor's
chair up to the pulpit, they are under
a lash as relentless as that of the
taskmaster of Egypt. For instance, we
might refer to Buchanan, of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Mercury</span>.
He has sat at his desk until he has
become an old man, with the smallest
imaginable subtraction of time for food
and sleep, writing night and day, and
carrying, in his comprehensive brain, the
whole details of an influential journal.
This feature, however, is not confined to
the Old World, and may easily be paralleled
in the journalism of America. Both
Raymond, of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>, and Bennett,
of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Herald</span>, almost live in the editorial
function; and the former of these,
though now Speaker of the Assembly,
will either pen his leaders in his desk,
during the utterance of prosy speeches,
or in hours stolen from sleep after adjournment.
In addition to these, we
might quote the caustic language of Mr.
Greeley, in reference to some mechanics
who had 'struck,' in order to reduce their
day's labor (we think to nine hours).

'He was in favor of short days of work,
and having labored eighteen hours per
diem for nearly twenty years, he was
now going to "strike" for fifteen during
the rest of his life.' But I doubt
the success of Mr. Greeley's 'strike,' and
apprehend that his early application has
continued with but little abatement.</p>

<p>Before leaving Edinburgh for the
New World, it was my good fortune to
become acquainted with Jeffrey. He was
at this time not so much distinguished
as the reviewer, as he was by his new title
of Lord Jeffrey, Judge of Court Session,
with a salary of 3000 per annum.
Lord Jeffrey was a small man, of light
but elegant make, and peculiarly symmetrical.
His head was quite small,
but his countenance was of an imposing
character; and his eye, brilliant but
not fierce, often melted into a pensive
tenderness. Such was Jeffrey's appearance
on the bench in his latter days. I
should have little judged from it that he
was the relentless critic, whoso withering
sarcasm was felt from the garrets
of Grub Street to the highest walk of
science or university life. My intimacy
with Ballantyne, who published the
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Edinburgh Review</span>, often brought the
different MSS. before me, and I could
contrast the exquisite neatness of Wardlaw
with the slanting school-boy hand of
Jeffrey. The tone and style of review
literature have changed greatly since its
inception, when each quarterly gloried
in the character of a literary ogre, and
dead men's bones lay round its doors, as
erst about the castle of Giant Despair.
Authors are not now thrown to the wild
beasts for the entertainment of the multitude,
as in former days; and had John
Keats, or even poor Henry Kirke White,
written and published fifty years later,
they would never have perished by the
critic's pen. Yet the same malignant
assault which crushed their tender muse
was the only thing which could amuse
the latent powers of a far greater genius;
and had not Byron been as cruelly
attacked by the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Edinburgh</span>, he would
never have given 'Childe Harold' to
the world. The authorship of that most
unjust and malignant <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">critique</span>, which,
however brief, was sufficient to make
the author of 'the Hours of Idleness,'

foe the time, contemptible, was long a
secret; but it is now admitted that it
was by Jeffrey. Little did the murderous
critic think that his challenge would
bring out an adversary who would soon
unhorse him, and then dash victoriously
over the field under the especial patronage
of fame.</p>

<h2>The Huguenot Families In America.</h2>


<p>III.</p>

<div>

<a name="toc_26"></a>
<h3>The Huguenots Of Ulster.</h3>


<p>It is said that the lands of the early
Huguenot settlers in Ulster County were
so arranged in small lots, and within sight
of each other, as to prevent surprise from
the Indians whilst their owners were cultivating
them. Louis Bevier, one of the
most honored patentees, was the ancestor
of the highly-respectable family bearing
his name in that region. When he was
about to leave France, his father became
so exasperated, that he refused to bestow
upon him the commonest civilities. Nor
would he condescend to return the kind
salutations of another son in the public
streets, affectionately offered by the pious
emigrant, and for the last time.</p>

<p>Another of the patentees, Deyo, visited
France to claim his confiscated estates,
but, failing of success, returned. Kingston,
at this early period, was the only
trading post or village for the French
Protestants, and sixteen miles distant
from their settlement, although in a
straight line. Paltz was not more than
eight miles west of the Hudson River;
this route, M. Deyo undertook, alone, to
explore&mdash;but never returned. It was
thought that the adventurous Huguenot
died suddenly, or was devoured by the
wild beasts. A truss and buckle which
he owned were found about thirty years
afterwards, at the side of a large hollow
tree. His life seems to have been one
full of toils and dangers, having endured
severe sufferings for conscience' sake, before
he reached Holland from France.
For days he concealed himself in hiding
places from his persecutors, and without
food, finally escaping alone in a fishing
boat, during a terrific storm.</p>

<p>The descendants of the Ulster Dubois
are very influential and numerous in our
day, but there is a tradition that this
family at one time was in great danger
of becoming extinct. For a long while
it was the custom of parents to visit
Kingston, for the purpose of having their
children baptized. M. Dubois and wife
were returning from such a pious visit,
and while crossing the Roundout, on the
ice, it gave way, plunging the horses,
sleigh and party in the rapid stream.
With great presence of mind, the mother
threw her infant, an only son, upon a
floating frozen cake, which, like the ark
of Moses, floated him safely down the
stream, until he was providentially rescued.
For some time this child was the
only male Dubois among the Paltz Huguenots,
and had he perished on that
perilous occasion, his family name would
also have perished with him; still there
were seven females of the same house,
called the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">seven zuisters</span>, all of whom
married among the most respectable
French Protestant families. To no stock
do more families in Ulster County trace
their origin than that of Dubois. Some
antiquarians deny this tradition of the
seven sisters, but contend that they were

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Lefevres</span>.</p>

<p>There were two Le Fevres among the
Ulster patentees. Their progenitors it is
said were among those early Protestants
of France who distinguished themselves
for intellectual powers, prominence in
the Reformed Church, with enduring patience
under the severest trials, and
death itself. Le Fevre, a doctor of theology,
adorned the French metropolis
when Paris caught the first means of
salvation in the fifteenth century. He
preached the pure gospel within its walls;
and this early teacher declared '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">our religion
has only one foundation, one object,
one head, Jesus Christ, blessed forever.
Let us then not take the name of Paul, of
Apostles, or of Peter. The Cross of
Christ alone opens heaven and shuts the
gates of hell</span>.' In 1524, he published a

translation of the New Testament, and
the next year a version of the Psalms.
Many received the Holy Scriptures from
his hands, and read them in their families,
producing the happiest results.
Margaret, the beautiful and talented
Princess of Valois, celebrated by all the
wits and scholars of the time, embraced
the true Christianity, uniting her fortune
and influence with the Huguenots, and
the Reformation thus had a witness in
the king's court. She was sister to
Francis the First, the reigning monarch.
By the hands of this noble lady,
the Bishop of Meuse sent to the king a
translation of St. Paul's Epistles, richly
illuminated, he adding, in his quaint and
beautiful language, 'They will make a
truly royal dish of fatness, that never
corrupts, and having the power to restore
from all manner of sickness. The
more we taste them, the more we hunger
after them, with desires that are ever
fed and never cloyed.'</p>

<p>Abraham Hasbroucq, which is the
original orthography of the name among
the patentees, was a native of Calais,
and the first emigrant of that family to
America, in 1675, with a party of Huguenot
friends; they resided for a while
in the Palatinate on the banks of the
Rhine. To commemorate their kindness,
when they reached our shores the new
settlement was called '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">De Paltz</span>,' now

'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">New Paltz</span>,' as the Palatinate was always
styled by the Dutch. Here, also,
the beautiful stream flowing through New
Paltz was known by the name of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Walkill</span>,
after the river Wael, a branch of
the Rhine, running into Holland.</p>

<p>The first twelve patentees, or the
'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Duzine</span>,' managed the affairs of the infant
settlement as long as they lived,
and after their death it was a custom
to elect a court officer from among the
descendants of each, at the annual town
meetings. For a long period they kept
in one chest all the important papers of
their property and land titles. The
pastor or the oldest man had charge
of the key, and reference was made to
this depository for the settlement of all
difficulties about boundaries. Hence
they were free from legal suits as to
their lands; and to this judicious, simple
plan may be traced the well-known harmony
of the numerous descendants in
this region,&mdash;the fidelity of their landmarks,
with the absence of litigation.</p>

<p>We know of no region in our land
where property has remained so long in
the same families, as it has at New Paltz;
since its first settlement, there has been
a constant succession of intermarriages
among the French descendants, and
many continue to reside upon the venerable
homesteads of their early and honored
forefathers.</p>

<p>Devoted as the Huguenots ever had
been to the worship of the Almighty,
one of their first objects at New Paltz
was the erection of a church. It was
built of logs, and afterwards gave place
to a substantial edifice of brick, brought
from Holland, the place answering the
double purpose of church and fort.
Their third house of worship was an
excellent stone building, which served
the Huguenots for eighty years, when
it was demolished in 1839, and the present
splendid edifice placed on the venerable
spot and dedicated to the service
of Almighty God. It is related that a
clergyman of eccentric dress and manners,
at an early period, would occasionally
make a visit to New Paltz, and, for
the purpose of meditation, would cross
the Walkill in a canoe, to some large
elms growing upon a bank opposite the
church; on one occasion the stream was
low, and while pushing across with a
pole, it broke, and the Dominie, losing
his balance, pitched overboard. He succeeded,
however, in reaching the shore,
and proceeded to the nearest house, for
the purpose of drying his clothes. This
partly accomplished, he entered the pulpit
and informed his congregation that
he had intended to have preached a sermon
on baptism; but, eyeing his garments,
he observed that <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">circumstances</span>
prevented, as he could now sympathize
with Peter, and take the text, 'Lord,
save, or I perish.'</p>

<p>To serve God according to the dictates
of their own conscience, had ever been a

supreme duty with the French Protestants,
and paramount to everything else.
For this they had endured the severest
persecutions in France, and had sacrificed
houses, lands, kindred and their
native homes; they had crossed a trackless
ocean, and penetrated the howling
wilderness, inhabited by savage tribes&mdash;and
for what?&mdash;To serve their MAKER,
and the RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE. They
had been the salt of France, and brought
over with them their pious principles,
with their Bibles,&mdash;the most precious
things. Some of these faded volumes
are still to be found among the children
of the American Huguenots, and we
have often seen and examined one of the
most venerable copies. It is Diodati's
French Bible, with this title:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">LA SAINTE<br />

BIBLE,<br />
INTERPRETEE PAR JEAN DIODATI,<br />
MDCXLIII.<br />
IMPRIMEE A GENEVE.</p>

<p>The sacred book is 219 years old, in
excellent condition, and well covered
with white dressed deerskin, its ties of
the same material. It was brought to
America by Louis Bevier, a French Protestant
of Ulster, and has been preserved
as a precious family relic through nine
generations. It was carried from France
to Holland, and thence to New Paltz.
'Blessed Book! the hands of holy martyrs
have unfolded thy sacred pages, and
their hearts been cheered by thy holy
truths and promises!' There is also a
family record written in the volume,
faintly legible, of the immediate descendants
of Louis Bevier and his wife,
Maria Lablau, from the year 1674 to
1684.</p>

<p>Above anything else did the Huguenots
of France love their BIBLES. Various
edicts, renewed in 1729, had commanded
the seizure and destruction of
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">all</span> books used by the Protestants, and
for this purpose, any consul of a commune,
or any priest, might enter the
houses to make the necessary search.
We may therefore compute by millions
the volumes destroyed in obedience to
these royal edicts. On the 17th of
April, 1758, about 40,000 books were
burned at one time in Bordeaux; and
it is also well known that at Beaucaire,
in 1735, there was an auto-da-f almost
equal to that of Bordeaux. It was
a truly sad day, in France, when the
old family BIBLE must be given up; the
book doubly revered and most sacred,
because it was the WORD of GOD, and
sacred too from the recollections connected
with it! Grandparents, parents,
and children, all, from their earliest infancy,
had daily seen, read and touched
it. Like the household deities of the ancients,
it had been always present at all
the joys and sorrows of the family. A
touching custom inscribed on the first
or last pages, and at times even upon
its margins, the principal events in all
those beloved lives. Here were the
Births, Baptisms, Marriages, and the
Deaths. Now all these tender, pious
records must perish at once in the flames.</p>

<p>But mind, immortal mind, could not
be destroyed; for free thought, and truth,
and instruction, among the people, were
companions of the Reformation, and
books would circulate among all ranks
throughout Protestant France. The
works generally came from Holland
through Paris, and from Geneva, by
Lyons or Grenoble. Inside of baled
goods, and in cases and barrels of provisions,
secretly, thousands of volumes
were sent from north to south, from east
to west, to the oppressed Huguenots.
The great work which Louis XIV. believed
buried beneath the ruins of his
bloody edicts still went on silently. At
Lausanne was established a seminary,
about the year 1725, where works for
the French Protestant people were printed
and circulated. The Bishop of Canterbury,
with Lord Warke, and a few
foreign sovereigns, actively assisted in
the founding of this institution. Thus
did that beautiful town become the source
of useful and religious knowledge to
thousands, although it was conveyed far
and wide in a very quiet and secret way.
One man was condemned to the galleys

for having received barrels, marked
'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Black and White Peas</span>,' which were
found full of 'Ostervald's Catechisms.'</p>

<p>How strange it seems to us, writing in
our own Protestant land, that cruel
authority should ever have intervened
with matters of faith! What can be
more plain or truthful than that there
should be liberty of conscience; and that
God alone has the power and the right
to direct it, and that it is an abuse and
a sacrilege to come between God and
conscience? After the revocation of
the edict of Nantes and the death of
Louis XIV., his royal successor sometimes
vaguely asked himself why he
persecuted his Protestant subjects? when
his marshal replied, that his majesty was
only the executor of former edicts. He
seemed to have consoled himself that he
had found the system <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">already</span> established,
and he only carried out the errors of his
predecessor. Forty years of remorseless
persecutions against his best subjects,
without asking himself why! Of all the
weaknesses of his reign, this was the
most odious and the most guilty; his
hand was most literally weary of signing
cruel edicts against the Protestants of
his kingdom, without even reading them,
and which obedience to his mandates
had to transcribe in letters of fire and
blood, on the remotest parts of his realm.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Frenchmen of
Ulster, who for some time after their
emigration used their own language, until
a consultation was held to determine
whether this, or the English or Dutch,
should be adopted in the families. As the
latter was generally spoken in the neighboring
places,&mdash;Kingston, Poughkeepsie
and Newburgh,&mdash;and also at the schools
and churches, it was decided to speak
Dutch only to their children and servants.
Having for a while, however,
continued the use of their native tongue,
some of the Huguenot descendants in
the Paltz still write their names as their
French ancestors wrote them more than
two centuries ago. Dubois, Bevier,
Deyeau, Le Fevre, Hasbroque, are well-known
instances.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Petronella</span> was once an admired name
among the Huguenot ladies, and became
almost extinct in Ulster at one time.
The last was said to have been Petronella
Hasbroque, a lady distinguished for
remarkable traits of character. Judge
Hasbroque, of Kingston, the father of the
former President of Rutger's College,
was very anxious that his son would give
this name to one of his daughters. In
case of compliance, a handsome marriage
portion was also promised; but the parents
declined the generous offer, whether
from a dislike to the name, or a belief
that the property would be theirs, at
any rate, some day, is not known. A
granddaughter, however, of a second
generation, named her first-born Petronella,
and thus gratifying the desire of
her near kinsman, secured a marriage
portion for the heir, and preserved the
much-admired name from oblivion&mdash;certainly
three important results.</p>

<p>It was a well-known and distinguished
trait of the New Paltz Huguenots, that
but few intermarriages have taken place
among their own families (<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Walloon</span>);
they differed in this respect from all
other French Protestants who emigrated
to America and mingled with the
other population by matrimonial alliances.
In Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and
other neighborhoods, near by, there is
an unusual number of Dutch names&mdash;the
Van Deusens, Van Benschotens,
Van Kleeds, Van Gosbeeks, Van De
Bogerts, Van Bewer, and others, almost
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">ad infinitum</span>, whilst for miles around the
populous and wealthy town of Old Paltz
scarcely a family can be found with such
patronymics. Notwithstanding, somewhat
like the Israelites, these Frenchmen
classed themselves, in a measure, as
a distinct and separate people; still, the
custom did not arise from any dislike to
the Hollanders,&mdash;on the contrary, they
were particularly attached to that people,
who had been their best friends, both in
Holland and America; and these associations
were ever of a most friendly
and generous character. After a while,
the Huguenots of Ulster adopted not
only the language, but the customs and
habits of the Dutch. After the destruction

of the Protestant churches at Rochelle,
in 1685, the colonists of that city
came in such numbers to the settlement
of New York, that it was necessary
sometimes to print public documents not
only in Dutch and English, but French
also.</p>

<p>We do not wish to make our articles
a Doomsday-book for the Huguenots, still
it is pleasant for their descendants to
know that they came from such honorable
stock, and, with all of our boasted
republicanism, we are not ashamed that
we <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">are</span> so born. Here are some of the
names to be found in the old records of
Ulster:&mdash;Abraham Hausbrough, Nicholas
Antonio, 'Sherriffe' Moses Quartain,
'Leon,' Christian Dubois, Solomon Hasbrook,
Andries Lafeever, Hugo Freer,
Peter Low, Samuel Boyce, Roeleff Eltinge,
'Esq.,' Nicholas Roosa, Jacobus

Thomas Bayeuk, Elia Neau, Paul Droilet,
Augustus Jay, Jean Cazeale, Benjamin
Faneil, Daniel Cromelin, John Auboyneau,
Francis Vincent, Ackande Alliare,
James Laboue (Minister). In 1713-14 we
find, in an address of the ministers and
elders of the Huguenot Church in New
York, 'Louis Rou, Minister of the French
Church, in New York, John Barberie,
Elder, Louis Can, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">ancien</span> (the older),

<div class="display">
<p>UNDER CURRENTS OF WALL STREET. A
Romance of Business. By Richard B.
Kimball, Author of 'St. Leger,' 'Romance
of Student Life,' &amp;c. New York: G.P.
Putnam; Boston: A.K. Loring. 1861.</p>

</div>

<p>In the United States about one person
in a hundred is engaged in mercantile
pursuits&mdash;in other words, in 'broking,'
or transferring from the producer to the
consumer. Of this number, a larger
proportion than in any other country
are brokers in the strict sense of the
word, buying, selling, or exchanging
money or its equivalents, and managing
credit so that others may turn it into
capital. A more active, eventful, precarious
and extraordinary life, or one
calling more for the exercise of sharpness
and shrewdness, does not exist, than
that of these men. They are among
regular business men what the 'free
lance' is among military men, or the
privateer among those of the true marine.
Any one who has been familiar
with one of the 'craft,' has probably
heard him say at one time or another&mdash;'what
I have seen would make one of
the most remarkable novels you ever
read;' and he spoke the literal truth.</p>

<p>Realizing this fact, Mr. KIMBALL, a
lawyer of twenty years' standing in Wall
St., and consequently perfectly familiar
with all its characteristics, has devoted
literary talents, which long ago acquired
for him not merely an enviable American
but a wide European celebrity, to
describing this broker-life, with its lights
and shadows. Choosing a single subject
and a single class, he has elaborated it
with a truthfulness which is positively
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">startling</span>. As we often know that a portrait
is perfect from its manifest verisimilitude,
so we feel from every chapter
of this book that the author has, with
strictest fidelity, adhered to real life with
pre-Raphaelitic accuracy but without
pre-Raphaelitic servility to any tradition
or set mannerism. The pencil of a reporter,
the lens of the photographer, are
recalled by his sketches, and not less
life-like, simple and excellent are the reflections
of the business office as shown
in its influence in the home circle. The
reader will recall the extraordinary popularity
which certain English romances,
setting forth humble unpoetic life, have
enjoyed of late years. We refer to the
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Adam Bede</span> and <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Silas Marner</span> school
of tales, in which every twig is drawn,
every life-lineament set forth with a sort
of DENNER minuteness&mdash;truthful, yet
constrained, accurate but petty. In this
novel, Mr. KIMBALL, while retaining all
the accuracy of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Adam Bede</span>, has swept
more broadly and forcibly out into life;&mdash;there
are strong sorrows, great trials
seen from the stand-point of a man of
the world, and a free, bold color which
startles us, while we, at the same time,
recognize its reality.</p>

<p>The 'hero' of the work is a merchant,
who, like many others after incurring
bankruptcy, takes to Wall Street&mdash;to
selling notes as an under-broker for a
living. In describing his trials, the author
has, with consummate skill and extraordinary
knowledge of both causes
and effects, pointed out the peculiarities,
institutions, and good or bad workings
of the American mercantile system, in
such a manner as to have attracted from
the soundest authority warm praise of
his work, as embodying practical knowledge
of a kind seldom found in 'novels.'
From 'broking' to speculating&mdash;from
that again to the old course&mdash;alternately

buoyed up or cast down, through
trials and troubles, the bankrupt, at last,
in his darkest hour, lands on that 'luck'
which in America comes sooner or later
to every one. It is worth remarking
that in all his characters, as in his scenes,
the author is careful to maintain the balance
of truth. He shows us that among
the sharks and harpies of Wall Street
there are phases of honor and generosity&mdash;that
the arrogance or coldness of a
bank-officer may have a rational foundation&mdash;that
feelings as intense are awakened
in common business pursuits as in
the most dramatic and erratic lives. In
this <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">just</span> treatment of character,&mdash;this
avoiding of the old saint and angel system
of depicting men,&mdash;KIMBALL is
truly pre-eminent, and under it even the
casual SOL DOWNER strikes us with an
individuality and a force not inferior to
that of the hero himself.</p>

<p>We can not take leave of this truly remarkable
book without referring to the
under-current of kindly, humane feelings
with which it abounds. There is a delicate,
tremulous sympathy for the sufferings
and joys which he depicts, which
reflects the highest credit on the author.
There are, in this book, unaffected
touches of pathos, founded on the most
natural events in the world, which have
never been surpassed by any novelist.</p>

<p>We are glad that novelists are leaving
romance and going to real life. One
breaking into the harsh industry of the
factory and market, another taking down
the joys and sorrows of the humble weaver,
another describing, as in this work,
the strange hurrying life of the 'outside
broker' to the sharpest-cut detail,&mdash;all

<p>MARGARET HOWTH. A Story of To-Day.
Boston: Ticknor &amp; Fields. 1862.</p>

</div>

<p>We know of no other truly American
novel into which so many elements have
been forced by the strength of genius
into harmony, as in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Margaret Howth</span>.
One may believe, in reading it, that the
author, wearied of the old cry that the
literature of our country is only a continuation
of that of Europe, had resolved
to prove, by vigorous effort, that it <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
possible to set forth, not merely the incidents
of our industrial life in many
grades, in its purely idiomatic force, but
to make the world realize that in it vibrate
and struggle outward those aspirations,
germs of culture and reforms
which we seldom reflect on as forming a
part of the inner-being of our very practical
fellow-citizens. The work has two
characteristics,&mdash;it breaks, with a strong
intellect and fine descriptive power, into
a new field, right into the rough of real
life, bringing out fresher and more varied
forms than had been done before,
and in doing this makes us understand,
with strange ability, how the thinkers
among our people <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">think</span>. We all know
how it flows <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">in</span> to them, from lecture and
book, from the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> and school&mdash;but
few, especially in the Atlantic cities,
know what becomes of culture among
men and women who 'work and weave
in endless motion' in the counting-house,
or factory, or through daily drudgery and
the reverses from wealth to poverty.
Others have treated a single **o [transcriber's note: illegible word] of life,
dramatically and by events, as well as
Miss HARDING, but no one American
has dared such intricacies of thought and
character in individuals&mdash;has raised
them to such a height, and developed
them with such a powerful will, without
falling into conventionalism or improbability.
Unlike most novels, its 'plot,'

though excellent, is its least attraction&mdash;we
can imagine that the superb pride
which gleams out in so many rifts has
induced the author to voluntarily avoid
display of that ingeniously spinning romantic
talent in which novelists excel
precisely in proportion to their lack of
all nobler gifts. It is a certain rule, as
to literary snobs, that in proportion as
the food which they give diminishes in
excellence, does the plate on which it is
served increase in value. But let none
imagine that <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Margaret Howth</span> lacks <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">interest</span>&mdash;it

is replete with burning, vivid,
thrilling interest&mdash;it has the attraction
which fascinates <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">all</span> readers, based in a
depth of knowledge so extraordinary
that it can be truly appreciated by but
few. The immense popularity which it
has acquired and the general praise
awarded it by the press, proves that it
has gone right to the hearts of the people&mdash;whence
it came.</p>

<p>Those who accuse <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Margaret Howth</span> of
harshness and a lack of winsomeness,
have neither understood the people
whom it describes nor the degree of stern
strength requisite to wrest from life and
nature fresh truth. The pioneers of
every great natural school (and every
indication shows that one is now dawning)
have quite other than lute-sounding
tasks in hand, however they may
hunger and thirst for beauty, love, and
rose-gardens. Under the current of this
book runs the keenest, painfulest craving
to give freely to life these very elements&mdash;its
intensest inner-spirit is of
love and beauty; it throbs and burns
with a sympathy for suffering humanity
which is at once fierce and tearful. As
regards the minor artistic defects of

<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Margaret Howth</span>, they are, if we regard
it entirely, the shadows inseparable from
its substance, felt by those who remain
in them, but in no wise detracting from
the beauty of the edifice when we regard
it from the proper point of view.</p>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<p>On the ninth of March President LINCOLN
made the first announcement of an
official endorsement of the great principle
of gradual Emancipation, by transmitting
to Congress a message recommending
that the United States ought
to coperate with any State which may
adopt a gradual emancipation of slavery,
by giving to such State pecuniary aid, to
be used at its discretion, to compensate
for the inconvenience, public and private,
which may be produced by any
such change of system.</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Any member of Congress, with the census
tables and the treasury notes before him, can
readily see for himself how very soon the current
expenditures of this war would purchase,
at a fair valuation, all the slaves in any named
State. Such a position on the part of the General
Government sets up no claim of a right
by federal authority to interfere with slavery
within State limits, referring, as it does, the
absolute control of the subject, in each case, to
the State and its people immediately interested.</p>
</div>

<p>It is almost needless to point out to
the reader that the views, both direct
and implied, which are urged in this
message, are in every respect identical
with those to advance which the CONTINENTAL
was founded, and for which
it has strenuously labored from the beginning.
There is nothing in them of
the 'Abolitionism' which advocates 'immediate
and unconditional' freeing of
the blacks; while, on the other hand, the
only persons who can object to them are
those who hold that slavery is a good
thing in itself, never to be disturbed.
It is, in short, all that the rational
friends of progress can at present desire&mdash;an
official recognition of the great
truth that slavery ought to be abolished,
but in such a manner as to cause the
least possible trouble.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe the bewilderment
of the pro-slavery Northern Democratic
press, which has so earnestly
claimed the Executive as 'conservative,'
and on which this message has fallen
like a thunder-clap. They have, of
course, at once cried out that, should it
receive the sanction of Congress, it
would still amount to nothing, because
no legislature of a slave State will accept
it; an argument as ridiculous as it
is trivial. That the South would, for the
present, treat the proposal with scorn,
is likely enough. But the edge of the
wedge has been introduced, and emancipation
has been at least <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">officially</span> recognized
as desirable. While such a
possible means of securing property exists,
there will always be a strong party
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">forming</span> in the South, whether they attain
to a majority or not, and this party
will be the germ of disaster to the secessionists.
There are men enough,
even in South Carolina, who would gladly
be paid for their slaves, and these
men, while maintaining secession views
in full bluster, would readily enough find
some indirect means of realizing money
on their chattels. It may work gradually&mdash;but
it <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">will</span> work. As disaster and
poverty increase in the South, there will
increase with them the number of those
who will see no insult or injury in the
proposition to buy from them property
which is becoming, with every year,
more and more uncertain in its tenure.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that this message
was based on the most positive
knowledge held by the Executive of the
desires of the Union men in the South,
and of their strength. The reader who
will reflect for a moment can not fail to
perceive that, unless it had such a foundation,
the views advanced in it would
have been reckless and inexplicable indeed.
It was precisely on this basis, and
in this manner, that the CONTINENTAL,
in previous numbers, and before it the

New York KNICKERBOCKER Magazine,
urged the revival of the old WEBSTER
theory of gradual remunerated emancipation,
declaring that the strength of
the Union party in the South was such
as to warrant the experiment.<a href="#note_15"><span class="footnoteref">15</span></a> We
have also insisted, in our every issue,
that, while emancipation should be borne
constantly in view and provided for as
something which must eventually be realized
for the sake of the advancing interests
of WHITE labor and its expansion,
everything should be effected as gradually
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">as possible</span>, so as to neither interfere
with the plans of the war now waging,
nor to stir up needless political strife.
We simply asked for some firmly-based
official recognition of the rottenness of
the 'slavery plank in the Southern platform,'
and trusted that the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">utmost</span> caution
and deliberation would be observed
in eventually forwarding emancipation.
We were literally alone, as a publication,
in these views, and were misrepresented
both by the enemies who were
behind us and the zealous friends who
were before us. We have never cried
for that 'unconditional and immediate
emancipation of slavery' with which the
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Liberator</span>, with the kindest intentions,
but most erroneously, credits us. We
should be glad enough to see it, were
it possible; but, knowing that the immediate-action
theory has been delaying
the cause for thirty years, we have
invariably suggested the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">firm</span> but gradual
method. That method has at last
been formally advanced by the President,
in a manner which can reasonably
give offense to no one. The beginning
has been made: it is for the country
to decide whether it&mdash;the most
important suggestion of the age&mdash;shall
be realized.</p>

<br />

<p>The news of the capture of Fort Donelson
had barely reached us, the roar of
the guns celebrating our rapid successes
had not died away, ere that fragment
of the Northern ultra pro-slavery party
which had done so much towards deluding
the South into secession, impudently
raised its head and began most inopportunely
and impertinently to talk of
amnesty and the rights of the South.
There are things which, under certain
limitations, may be right in themselves,
but which, when urged at the wrong
time, become wrongs and insults; and
these premature cries to restore the enemy
to his old social and political standing
are of that nature. They are insufferable,
and would be ridiculous, were
it not that in the present critical aspect
of our politics they may become dangerous.
Since this war began, we have
heard much of the want of true loyalty
in the ultra abolitionists, who would
make the object of the struggle simply
emancipation, without regard to consequences;
and we have not been sparing
in our own condemnations of such a limited
and narrow view,&mdash;holding, as we
do, that emancipation, if adopted, should
be for the sake of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">white man</span> and the
Union, and not of the negro. But 'Abolition'
of the most one-sided and suicidal
description is less insulting to those who
are lavishing blood and treasure on the
great cause of freedom, than is the conduct,
at this time, of those men who are
now, through their traitorous organs,
urging the cry that the hour is at hand
when we must place slavery firmly on a
constitutional basis; this being, as they
assert, the only means whereby the Union
can ever be harmoniously restored.</p>

<p>In view of the facts, it is preposterous
to admit that this assumption is even
plausible. He must be ignorant indeed
of our political history during the past
twenty years, or strangely blind to its
results, who has not learned that a belief
that the North is ever anxious to
concede for the sake of its 'interests'
has been the great stimulus to the arrogance
of the South. While the principles
of the abolitionists have been the
shallow <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">pretence</span>, the craven cowardice
of such men as BUCHANAN and CUSHING
has been the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">real</span> incitement to the
South to pour insult and wrong on the
North. Concession has been our bane.
It was paltering and concession that

palsied the strong will and ready act
which should have prevented this war;
for had it not been for such men as the
traitors who are now crying out for
Southern rights, the rebellion would
have been far more limited in its area,
and long since crushed out. No cruelties
on our part, no threats to carry all
to the bitter end, would so encourage
the South at present, as this offer to
shake hands ere the fight be half over.</p>

<p>When the time comes for amnesty
and 'Southern Rights,' we trust that
they will be considered in a spirit of
justice and mercy. Till it comes let
there be no word spoken of them. The
South has, to its own detriment and
to ours, firmly and faithfully <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">believed</span>
that Northern men are cowards, misers,
men sneaking through life in all
dishonor and baseness. When millions
believe such intolerable falsehoods of
other millions of their fellow-citizens,
they must be taught the truth, no matter
what the lesson costs. Even now
the Southern press asserts that our victories
were merely the results of overwhelming
majorities, and that the Yankees
are becoming frightened at their
own successes. There is not one of these
traitorous, dough-face meetings of which
the details are not promptly sent&mdash;probably
by the men who organize them&mdash;all
over the South to inspire faith in a
falling cause. When the rebels shall
have learned that these traitors have
positively <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">no</span> influence here,&mdash;and the
sooner they learn it the better,&mdash;when
they realize that the people of the North
are as determined as themselves, and
their equals in all noble qualities, then,
and not till then, will it be time to talk
of those concessions which now strike
every one as smacking of meanness and
cowardice.</p>

<p>The day has come for a new order of
things. The South must learn&mdash;and
show by its acts that it has been convinced&mdash;that
the North is its equal in
those virtues which it claims to monopolize.
But this it will only learn from
the young and vigorous minds of the
new school,&mdash;from its <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">enemies</span>,&mdash;and
not from the trembling old-fashioned
traitors, who have been so long at its
feet that they shiver and are bewildered,
now that they are fairly isolated, by the
tide of war, from their former ruler.
Politicians of this stamp, who have grown
old while prating of Southern rights,
can not, do not, and never will <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">realize</span>
but that, some day or other, all will be
restored in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">statu quo ante bellum</span>. They
expect Union victories, but somehow believe
that their old king will enjoy his
own again&mdash;that there will be a morning
when the South will rule as before.
It is this which inspires their craven
timidity. They cry out against emancipation
in every form,&mdash;blind to the onward
and inevitable changes which are
going on,&mdash;so that when the South
comes in again they may point to their
record and say, '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">We</span> were ever true to
you. We, indeed, urged the war, for
we were compelled by you to fight,
but we were always true to your main
principles.' They have wasted time and
trouble sadly&mdash;it will all be of no avail.
Be it by the war, be it by what means
it may, the social system and political
rule of the South are irrevocably doomed.
It may, from time to time, have its convulsive
recoveries, but it is doomed.
The demands of free labor for a wider
area will make themselves felt, and
the black will give way to the white, as
in the West the buffalo vanishes before
the bee.</p>

<p>We are willing that the question of
emancipation should have the widest
scope, and, if expediency shall so dictate,
that it should be realized in the most
gradual manner. We believe that, owing
to the experiences of the past year,
more than one slave State will, ere long,
contain a majority of clear-headed, patriotic
men, who will be willing to legalize
the freedom of all blacks born within
their limits, after a certain time; and
if this time be placed ten years or even
fifteen hence, it will make no material
difference. By that time the pressure
of free labor, and the increase of manufacturing,
will have rendered some such
step a necessity. Should the payment

of all loyal slave-holders, in the border
States, for their chattels, prove a better
plan,&mdash;and it could hardly fail to
promptly reduce the rebellious circle to
a narrow and uninfluential body,&mdash;let it
be tried. If any of the arguments thus
far adduced in favor of assuming slavery
to be an institution which is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">never</span>
to be changed, and which <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">must</span> be immutably
fixed in the North American
Union, can be proved to be true, we
would say, then let emancipation be forever
forgotten&mdash;for the stability of the
Union must take precedence of everything.
But we can not see it in this
light. We can not see that peace and
Union can exist while the slave-holder
continues to increase in arrogance in
the South, and while the abolitionists
every day gather strength in the North.
Every day of this war has seen the enemies
of slavery increase in number and
in power, until to expect them to lose
power and influence is as preposterous
as to hope to see the course of nature
change. Should a peace be now patched
up on the basis of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">immutable</span> slavery,
we should, to judge from every appearance,
simply prolong the war to an infinitely
more disastrous end than it now
threatens to assume. We should incur
debts which would crush our prosperity;
we should bequeath a heritage of woe to
our children, which would prove their
ruin. While the great cause of all this
dissension lies legalized and untouched,
there will continue to be a party which
will never cease to strive to destroy it.
The question simply is, whether we will
be wounded now, or utterly slain by and
by.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us, before all things,
push on with the war! It is by our victories
that slavery will be in the beginning
most thoroughly attacked. If the
South, as it professes, means to fight to
the last ditch, and to the black flag, all
discussion of emancipation is needless;
for in the track of our armies the contraband
assumes freedom without further
formula. But we are by no means
convinced that such will be the case.
The <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">first</span> ditches have, as yet, been by no
means filled with martyrs to secession,&mdash;armistices
are already subjects of rumor,&mdash;and
it should not be forgotten
that the Union men of the South are
powerful enough to afford efficient aid
in placing the question of ultimate emancipation
on a basis suitable to all interests.</p>

<p>All that the rational emancipationist
requires is a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">legal beginning</span>. We have
no desire to see it advance more rapidly
than the development of the country requires&mdash;in
short, what is really needed
is simply the assurance that by war or
by peace <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">some</span> basis shall be found for
ultimately carrying out the views of the
fathers of the American Union, and rendering
this great nation harmonious and
happy. Every day brings us nearer the
great issue,&mdash;not of slavery and anti-slavery,&mdash;but
whether slavery is to be
assumed as an immutable element in
America, or whether government will
bring such influences to bear as will lead
the way to peace and the rights of free
labor. Every step is leading us to</p>

<p>The N.O. <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Delta</span> is full of indignation
at the Southern men who are alarmed
for their property, and betrays, in its
anger, the fact that these disaffected
persons are not few in the Pelican State.
But, plucking up courage, it declares
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Our people will retire into the interior, and
in their mountains and swamps they will maintain
a warfare which must ultimately prove
successful.</p>
</div>

<p>Doubtful&mdash;very. In the first place,

'our people' can not very well swamp
it like runaway negroes, and, secondly,
they will encounter, in the mountains,
the Union men of the South. Give us
the cities and the level country for a
short time, and we shall very soon find
the Pelicandidates for comfortable quarters
rolling back, by thousands, into
Unionism.</p>

<br />

<p>As we write, there is a panic in Richmond,
caused by the discovery that there
is a large body of Union men in the city
itself, headed by JOHN MINOR BOTTS,
who seems to have determined to 'head
off' the secession party in its stronghold,
'or die'&mdash;he having, since the decease
of JOHN TYLER, turned his
'heading off' abilities against JEFF DAVIS.
The <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Examiner</span> mentions, in terror,
the confession of the Union prisoners,
that there are in Richmond 'thousands
of arms concealed, and men enrolled,
who would use them on the first approach
of the Yankee army.' One of
the arrested, a Mr. STEARNS, when led
to the prison, surveyed it in a most contemptuous
manner, remarking 'If you
are going to imprison all the Union men
in Richmond, you will have to provide
a much larger jail than this.'</p>

<p>It is the German residents of Richmond
who are said to constitute the majority
of these Union men. All honor
to our German friends of the South!
They have received, thus far, too little
credit for their staunch adherence to the
principles of freedom. Let them take
courage; a day is coming when we
shall all be free&mdash;free from <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">every</span> form
of slavery! <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Noch ist die Freiheit nicht
verloren</span>!&mdash;'Freedom is not lost as yet.'
Some of them remember <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span> song of
old.</p>

<br />

<p>A paragraph has recently gone
the rounds, which impudently assures
the friends of Emancipation that, unless
they promptly desist from further interference
or agitation, they will speedily
build up a Southern party in the North,
which will seriously interfere with the
prosecution of the war!</p>

<p>That is to say, that the majority of the
people of the North fully acquiesce in
the justice of the main principles held
by the South&mdash;the only difference of
opinion being whether these slavery and
slavery-extension doctrines can be practically
developed under our federal
Union! Yet we, knowing, seeing,
feeling, in this war, the enormously evil
effects of the slave system on the free
men among whom it exists, are expected
to endure and legalize <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">the cause</span> which
stirred it up! Either the South is right
or wrong&mdash;there is no escaping the dilemma.
Either it was or was not justly
goaded by 'abolition' into secession.
If the South is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">quite</span> right in wishing to
preserve slavery intact forever, surely
those are in the wrong who would make
war on it for wishing to secede from a
government which tolerates attacks on
legalized institutions! What a precious
paradox have we here? Yet these virtual
justifiers of the South in the great
cause of the war, claim to be zealous and
forward in punishing that secession
which, according to their own views, is
constitutional and right!</p>

<p>If slavery be right, then the South is
right. No impartial foreigner could fail
to draw this conclusion under the circumstances
of this war. But <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">is</span> it right;
we do not say as a thing of the past, and
of a rapidly vanishing serf-system, but as
an institution of the progressive present?
Witness the words of G. BATELLE, a
member of the Western Virginia Constitutional
Convention,&mdash;as we write, in
session at Wheeling,&mdash;and who has published
an address to that body on the
question of Emancipation, from which
we extract the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>The injuries which slavery inflicts upon
our own people are manifold and obvious.
It practically aims to enslave not merely
another race, but our own race. It inserts
in its bill of rights some very high-sounding
phrases securing freedom of speech; and
then practically and in detail puts a lock on
every man's mouth, and a seal on every
man's lips, who will not shout for and swear
by the divinity of the system. It amuses
the popular fancy with a few glittering generalities

in the fundamental law about the
liberty of the press, and forthwith usurps
authority, even in times of peace, to send
out its edict to every postmaster, whether in
the village or at the cross-roads, clothing
him with a despotic and absolute censorship
over one of the dearest rights of the citizen.
It degrades labor by giving it the badge of
servility, and it impedes enterprise by withholding
its proper rewards. It alone has
claimed exemption from the rule of uniform
taxation, and then demanded and received
the largest share of the proceeds of that
taxation. Is it any wonder, in such a state
of facts, that there are this day, of those
who have been driven from Virginia mainly
by this system, men enough, with their descendents,
and means and energy, scattered
through the West, of themselves to make no
mean State?...</p>

<p>It has been as a fellow-observer, and I
will add as a fellow-sufferer, with the members
of the Convention, that my judgment
of the system of slavery among us has been
formed. We have seen it seeking to inaugurate,
in many instances all too successfully,
a reign of terror in times of profound peace,
of which Austria might be ashamed. We
have seen it year by year driving out from
our genial climate, and fruitful soil, and exhaustless
natural resources, some of the men
of the very best energy, talent and skill
among our population. We have seen also,
in times of peace, the liberty of speech taken
away, the freedom of the press abolished,
and the willing minions of this system, in
hunting down their victims, spare from degradation
and insult neither the young, nor
the gray-haired veteran of seventy winters,
whose every thought was as free from offense
against society as is that of the infant
of days.</p>

</div>

<p>When an evil attains this extent, he
is a poor citizen, a poor cowardly dallier
with opinions, whatever his fighting mark
may be, who can make up his mind to
calmly acquiesce in establishing its permanence,
or to stiffly oppose every movement
and every suggestion tending in
the least towards its abrogation.</p>

<br />

<p>In the present number of the CONTINENTAL
will be found an article on General
LYON, in which reference is made to
the generally credited assertion, that the
deceased hero was not reinforced as he
desired during the campaign in Missouri.
This is one of the questions which time
alone will properly answer. In accordance
with the principles involved in <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">audi
alteram partem</span>, we give on this subject
the following abridgment of a portion
of General FREMONT'S defense,
published in the New York <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> of
March 6:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">

<p>Lyon's and Prentiss's troops were nearly
all three months men, whose term of enlistment
was about expiring. Arms and money
were wanted, but men offered in abundance.
The three months men had not been paid.
The Home Guards were willing to remain
in the service, but their families were destitute.
Gen. Fremont wrote to the President,
stating his difficulties, and informing him
that he should peremptorily order the United
States Treasurer there to pay over to his
paymaster-general the money in his possession,
sending a force at the same time to
take the money. He received no reply, and
assumed that his purpose was approved.</p>

<p>Five days after he arrived at St. Louis
he went to Cairo, taking three thousand
eight hundred men for its reinforcement.
He says that Springfield was a week's march,
and before he could have reached it, Cairo
would have been taken by the rebels, and
perhaps St. Louis. He returned to St.
Louis on the 4th of August, having in the
meantime ordered two regiments to the relief
of Gen. Lyon, and set himself to work
at St. Louis to provide further reinforcements
for him; but he claims that Lyon's
defeat can not be charged to his administration,
and quotes from a letter from General
Lyon, dated on the 9th of August, expressing
the belief that he would be compelled to
retire; also, from a letter written by Lyon's
adjutant general, in which he says 'General
Fremont was not inattentive to the situation
of General Lyon's column.'</p>
</div>

<br />

<p>A daily cotemporary, in an onslaught
on Emancipation, contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Delaware has recently had a proposition
before the legislature to abolish the scarcely
more than nominal slavery still existing in
it; but the legislature adjourned without
even listening to it, though it contemplated
full pecuniary compensation.</p>
</div>


<p>Yes; and the legislature of Delaware,
a few years ago, legalized lotteries,&mdash;one
of the greatest social curses of
the country,&mdash;and made itself a hissing
and a by-word to all decent men by
sanctioning the most widely-destructive
method of gambling known. The Delaware
legislature indeed!</p>

<br />

<p>We are indebted to a friend for the
following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>It is deeply significant that since the late
Federal victories, the Southern press, even
in Richmond itself, speaks nervously and
angrily of the Union men among them, and
of their increasing boldness in openly manifesting
their sentiments. A few months
since, this belief in Union men in the South
was abundantly ridiculed by those who believed
that all the slave-holding States were
unanimous in rebellion, and that therefore it
would be preposterous to hope to reconcile
them to emancipation. Now that the Union
strength in that region is beginning to manifest
itself, we are informed that we shall lose
it if we do aught contrary to Southern
rights. And this too, although the Southern
Union men have never been spoken of
by their rebel neighbors as aught save 'the
abolitionists in our midst!'</p>
</div>

<br />

<p>The following communication from a
well-known financier and writer on currency
can not fail to be read with interest
by all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>THE SINEWS OF WAR.</p>

<p>These are, men and money, but especially
MONEY, for on the money depends the
men. In a good cause, with an educated,
intelligent people, every man able to discern
for himself the right side of the question presented,
there is no difficulty about men; the
state has only to say how many are needed,
and the want will be promptly supplied.
The experience of the last six months gives
us evidence sufficient on this point: an army
of six hundred thousand men drawn together
without an effort, every man a volunteer,&mdash;a
spectacle never before exhibited to
the world,&mdash;puts at rest all doubt upon it;
and not only that, it settles beyond all cavil
the superiority of self-government, based on
the broadest principles of freedom and the
broadest system of education, over any other
form which has ever been adopted. Passing
from this, however, as a fact which needs no
argument or illustration, we come to the more
difficult question of how to raise the other
sinew&mdash;money.</p>

<p>In calling for men the state relies upon
the intelligence and patriotism of its citizens;
upon their intelligence to understand
the cause, on their patriotism to respond to
its call. It offers them no inducements in the
shape of pay, nothing more than to feed and
clothe them, to aid them hereafter if wounded,
to keep their families from starvation if
they are killed. This is all; and this is
enough. But these assumed obligations of
the state must be sacredly and promptly
kept. Our noble volunteers must be fed,
and clothed, and cared for, and to this end
the state must have the requisite means.
And to obtain the needed supply without
oppressive taxation on the one hand, or
placing a load on posterity too heavy to be
borne on the other hand, is a question of
difficult solution; and yet we shall see that
there is in the present administration the
ability and the will to solve it.</p>

<p>It is said that our expenditures in this
great struggle will, by the first of June,
amount to the enormous sum of $600,000,000.
It is said by the arch traitor at the
head of the rebels that under this load of
debt we shall sink. It is said by the leading
papers of England that we have no
money, have exhausted our credit, must disband
our armies, and make the best terms we
can with rebellion. Doubtless, our credit
in Europe is at a low ebb just now, and we
are thrown upon our own resources, and on
these we must swim or sink. There is nothing
to reject in this. We have shown the
world how a free state can raise troops and
create a navy out of its own materials; and
now we will show the world how a free state
can maintain its army and navy out of its
own resources; and if the result proves&mdash;as
it will prove&mdash;that our free institutions are
the safest, strongest, and best for the people
in war as well as in peace, then the great
struggle we are now going through with will
be worth more to the true interests of humanity
everywhere than all the battles which have
been fought since the dawn of the present
century. For a hundred years, openly or
covertly, but without intermission, has war
been going on between despotism and freedom,
with varied success, but on the whole
with a steady gain for freedom; and now

here, on the same field where it originated,
is the long strife to be finally settled. On
these same fields the same freedom is to culminate
in unquenchable splendor, or to set
forever, leaving mankind to grope in darkness
and ignorance under the misrule of
despotic tyranny. We are in arms not only
to suppress an odious uprising of despotism
against freedom within our own borders, but
to show by our example, to all the nations
of the earth, what freedom is and what freedom
means.</p>

<p>In seeking aid of the money power, we go
beyond the line where patriotism gives us all
we need, promptly and liberally, into the
cold region of selfishness, whose people are
too much absorbed in adding to and counting
up their gains to be able to spare much
time or thought on country or freedom. No
voluntary sacrifices to be expected here.
What we want we must buy, and pay for; it
is only to see that we do not pay too much
for it. Selfish, timid, grasping, these people
are a skittish set to deal with. Nobody
understands better the game of 'the spider
and the fly,' and they are as ready to play it
with the state as with smaller opponents, if
the state will but let them. From his first
visit to this region, to the present time, our
able Secretary of the Treasury was, and continues
to be, '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">master of the position</span>.'</p>

<p>When the Secretary held his first sociable
with the representatives of the money power,
neither he nor they had a very keen perception
of what they wanted of each other;
the rebellion was not then developed in the
gigantic proportions it has since assumed;
and it was hoped and expected, with some
show of reason, that two or three hundred
millions would be enough to put it down.
This amount the power could and would willingly
furnish for a 'consideration,' the half
presently, on condition that it should be allowed
the refusal of the other half when it
should be wanted; and so a bargain was quickly
struck, to the mutual content of both parties.
But, as the thunder grew louder and
the storm fiercer, it became evident that our
wants would soon be doubled, at least. The
money power hung back; the 7-3/10 remained
in the banks. The representatives said they
were only agents, the agents stopped payment,
and the whole circulation of gold fell to
the ground at once, not only putting a sudden
check upon all business operations, but leaving
the Treasury without any sort of currency
to pay out: a sad state of things enough.
The money power drew in its head, pretending
not to see anything, waiting for propositions,
expecting to reap a rich harvest out
of the state's necessities, by making its own
terms. How could it be otherwise? must
not the state have several hundred millions?
must not the astute Secretary sell the state's
promises to pay, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">secured by a first mortgage
on all Uncle Sam's vast possessions</span>, on their
own terms?</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant predicament for a
nervous or a faint-hearted man to be placed
in. But then Mr. Chase is neither nervous
nor faint-hearted, and when Congress came
together he not only told his wants frankly,
but proposed a neat little plan for supplying
them without selling notes at fifty per cent.
discount. Taking into view the want of a
sound currency for business purposes, and the
want of some currency to pay out from the
Treasury instead of the gold which had disappeared
and left a vacuum, he proposed to
borrow $150,000,000, by issuing Treasury
Notes, payable on demand, without interest,
and making them a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">legal tender for the payment
of all debts</span>, with a proviso that any parties
who should at any time have more on
hand than they wanted should be allowed to
invest them in bonds bearing six per cent interest.
It was a very simple proposition&mdash;almost
sublime for its simplicity; there was
no mystery about it; and yet it was the very
turning point of the ways and means of
crushing the rebellion, without being ourselves
crushed under an unbearable burden
of debt. The money power stood aghast,
and hardly recovered breath in time to oppose
its passage through Congress; but the common
sense of the people hailed Mr. Chase as
a deliverer, and Congress endorsed common
sense. Seriously, this splendid invention of
the Secretary has given a new face to our
financial affairs by placing the money power
where it always should be,&mdash;in subservience
to the people,&mdash;instead of allowing it to become
a grinding task-master. The importance
of this measure can hardly be appreciated
yet. A member of Congress, himself a
merchant, and an able financier, says:</p>

<p>'My theory in regard to it is, that as the
currency is increased by the addition of these
notes to its volume, prices generally will
rise, including the price of U.S. bonds, until
they reach par; at that point, these notes,
being convertible into bonds, the rise in the
price of bonds will stop, because further additions
to the currency, whether of these

notes, bank notes, or coin, will only stimulate
the conversion of notes into bonds; and
that conversion will check the increase of
currency. The <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">excess</span> of notes will then be
gradually withdrawn from circulation for
conversion,&mdash;leaving only such an amount
in circulation as a healthy and natural condition
of the currency will require.'</p>

<p>A theory in which we fully concur. We
see growing out of it a restoration of business:
government creditors paid in a currency
equal to gold; low prices for all government
contracts; a consequent diminished
expenditure for supplies, and an annual payment
for interest on the debt we shall owe,
which can be easily met without heavy taxation.
However it may turn out in the conduct
of the war,&mdash;and we have full faith in
that also,&mdash;it is very certain that in the conduct
of the finances we have found the man
for the times. The whole country feels this,
and breathes easier for it. The arch rebel,
in a recent address to his satellites, admits
that he altogether underestimated the patriotism
and loyalty of the men of the North,
but takes fresh courage from the certainty
that we shall shortly back down under our
load of debt. A little further on and he
will find that he has just as much mistaken
our power in that respect,&mdash;that as his own
worthless promises, based upon nothing, fall
to nothing, the notes of the Union will stand
as firm and as fair in the money market as
her banner will on the battle-field.</p>

<p>Men and money are the sinews of war.
In our first trial, patriotism has furnished the
men, and the presiding genius of the Treasury
has clearly pointed out the means for
obtaining the money. <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Laus Deo</span>!</p>

<br />

<p>Note.&mdash;For the benefit of those of our readers
who do not understand currency facts and
theories, we make the following explanation.
The relation of currency, or circulation medium,
to the industry and business of the state, is
similar to that of steam in an engine: a certain
amount is required to keep up a regular and
natural movement; an excessive amount causes
too rapid motion, and a deficiency the reverse.
Currency is made up of several things. Bank
deposits, circulating by checks, bank notes,
and coin, are the most important and best understood.
The aggregate amount of these
three items before the suspension of specie payments
was above $450,000,000; and this sum is
required to give a healthy movement to business
affairs. Take away any portion of it, and
prices fall and labor languishes, because the
motion from it is too small for the work required;
add considerably to it, and prices rise,
because the motive power, being superabundant,
is too freely used. When specie payment was
suspended this motive power was reduced; the
circulating medium fell from four hundred and
fifty to three hundred and fifty millions, perhaps
less; and unless this loss is replaced it
is quite clear that prices must fall and the employment
of labor be curtailed. The issue of
treasury notes will fill the gap, making the
business motive power of the same strength
and ability as before. Thus it will be seen that
the emission of treasury notes plays an important
part upon the industry and business of the
state, which, under existing circumstances, can
hardly be over-valued, as well as in the national
finances.</p>

<p>Who has not belonged in his time to a
debating society? What youth ambitious
of becoming 'a perfect <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Hercules</span>
behind the bar?'&mdash;as a well meaning
but unfortunate Philadelphian once said
in a funeral eulogy over a deceased legal
friend&mdash;has not 'debated' in a club
'formed for purposes of mutual <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">and</span> literary
improvement of the mind?' All
who have will read with pleasure the following
letter from one who has most
certainly been there:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>DEAR CONTINENTAL:</p>

<p>I am a man that rides around over the
'kedn'try.' In the little village where I am
now tarrying, the school-house bell is ringing
to call together the members of that ancient
institution peculiar to villages, the debating
society. A friend informs me that the time-honored
questions&mdash;Should capital punishment
be abolished?&mdash;Did Columbus deserve
more praise than Washington?&mdash;Is art
more pleasing to the eye than nature?&mdash;have
each had their turn in their regular rotation,
and that the question for to-night is&mdash;as you
might suppose&mdash;Has the Indian suffered
greater wrongs at the hands of the White
man than the Negro? As I have a distinct
recollection of having thoroughly investigated
and zealously declaimed on each of the
above topics in days lang syne, I shall excuse
myself from attendance this evening, on
the ground that I am already extensively informed
on the subject in hand, and my mind
is fully made up. But I hereby acknowledge
my indebtedness to the good fellow who told
me the object of the ringing of the bell&mdash;for
he has unconsciously started up some of
the most amusing recollections of my life.
Sitting here alone in my room, I have just
taken a hearty laugh over a circumstance
that had well-nigh given me the slip. The
question was the same Negro-Indian-White-man
affair. One of the orators, having,
a long time previously, seen a picture in
an old 'jography' of some Indians making
a hubbub on board certain vessels, and
reading under it, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Destruction of Tea in Boston
Harbor</span>, brought up the circumstance,
and insisting with great earnestness that the
white man had received burning wrongs at
the hands of the Indian, and that the latter
had <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">no reason at all to complain</span>, dwelt with
great emphasis on the ruthless destruction
of the white man's tea in Boston Harbor by
the latter, in proof of his 'point.'</p>

<p>I remember also a debating society in the
little village of R&mdash;&mdash;, which numbered
some really very worthy and intelligent
members, but of course included some that
were otherwise, among whom was a silly
young fellow, who had mistaken his proper
calling&mdash;(he should have been a wood-chopper),
and was suffering under an attack
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">at</span> medicine. The question for debate on
one occasion was&mdash;Is conscience an infallible
guide? Being expected to take part in
the discussion, he was bent on thorough
preparation, and ransacked his preceptor's
professional library&mdash;(almost as poor a
place as a lawyer's) for a work on <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">conscience</span>.
He found abundance of matter, however, for
a lengthy chapter on the subject, as he supposed,
occurring in several of the dusty octavos,
and he thumbed the leaves with most
patient assiduity. He had misspelled the
word however, and was reading all the while
on <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">consciousness</span>&mdash;a subject which would
very naturally occur in some departments of
medicine. But it was all one to him, he
didn't see the difference, and the ridiculous
display he made to us of his 'cramming' on
consciousness can be better imagined than
described.</p>

<p>Years after found me inside college walls&mdash;but
colleges in the West, be it remembered,

sometimes include preparatory departments,
into which, by the courtesy of
the teachers, many young men are admitted
who would hardly make a respectable figure
in the poorest country school, but who by
dint of honest toil finally do themselves
great credit.</p>

<p>I 'happened in' on a number of such,
one evening, whose affinities had drawn them
together with a view to forming a debating
society, to be made exclusively of their own
kind. I listened with much interest and
pleasure to the preliminaries of organization,
and smiled, when they were about to 'choose
a question,' to see them bring out the same
old coaches mentioned in the beginning of
this article; when one of their number
arose, evidently dissatisfied with the old
beaten track, and seemed bent on opening a
new vein. He was a good, honest, patient
fellow, but his weakness in expressing himself
was, that, although his delivery was
very slow, he didn't know how he was going
to end his sentences when he began them.
'Mr. President,' said he, 'how would this
do? Suppose a punkin seed sprouts in one
man's garden, and the vine grows through
the fence, and bears a punkin on another
man's ground&mdash;now&mdash;(a long pause)&mdash;the
question is&mdash;whose punkin&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">does it
belong to?</span>' The poor fellow subsided, as
might be supposed, amid a roar of voices
and a crash of boots.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a legal axiom which would
settle the pumpkin-vine query&mdash;that of
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum</span>&mdash;'ownership
in the soil confers possession
of everything even as high as heaven.'
Our friends in Dixie seem determined
to prove that they have also fee
simple in their soil downwards as far as
the other place, and by the last advices
were digging their own graves to an extent
which will soon bring them to the
utmost limit of their property!</p>

<br />

<p>Does the reader remember Poor Pillicoddy,
and the mariner who was ever
expected to turn up again? Not less
eccentric, as it seems to us, is the re-apparition
chronicled in the following story
by a friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>TURNING UP AGAIN!</p>

<p>'You were all through that Mexican war,
and out with Walker in Niggerawger.&mdash;Well,
what do you think 'bout Niggerawger?
Kind of a cuss'd 'skeeter hole, ain't it?'</p>

<p>'Tain't so much 'skeeters as 'tis snaiks,
scorpiums and the like,' answered the gray-moustached
corporal. 'It's hot in them
countries as a Dutch oven on a big bake;
and going through them parts, man's got to
move purty d&mdash;&mdash;d lively to git ahead of
the yaller fever; it's right onto his tracks the
hull time.'</p>

<p>'Did you git that gash over your nose out
there?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I got that in a small scrimmage under
old GRAY EYES. 'Twas next day <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">after
a fight</span> though, cum to think on it. We'd
been up there and took a small odobe hole
called Santa Sumthin', and had spasificated
the poperlashun, when I went to git a gold
cross off an old woman, and she up frying-pan
of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">frijoles</span> and hit me, so!' Here the
corporal aimed a blow with his pipe at the
face of the high private he was talking with;&mdash;the
latter dodged it.</p>

<p>'That was a big thing, that fight at Santa
Sumthin'; the way we went over them mud
walls, and wiped out the Greasers, was a
cortion. I rac'lect when we was drawed up
company front, afore we made the charge,
there was a feller next me in the ranks&mdash;I
didn't know him from an old shoe, 'cause
he'd ben drafted that morning into us from
another company. Says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>'We're going into hair and cats' claws 'fore
long, and as I'm unbeknownst amongst you
fellers, I'd like to make a bargain with you.'</p>

<p>'Go it,' says I; 'I'm on hand for ennything.'</p>

<p>'Well,' says he, 'witchever one of us gits
knocked over, the tother feller 'll look out
for him, and if he ain't a goner 'll haul him
out, so the doctor can work onto him.'</p>

<p>'Good,' says I, 'you may count me in
there; mind you look after ME!'</p>

<p>The fight began, and when we charged,
the fust thing I knowed the feller next me,
wot made the bargain, he went head over
heels backwards; and to tell the honest
trooth, I was just that powerful egsited I
never minded him a smite, but went right
ahead after plunder and the Greasers, over
mud walls and along alleys, till I got, bang
in, where I found something worth fighting
about it. 'Bout dusk, when we was all purty
full of <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">agwadenty</span>, they sent us out to bury
our fellers as was killed in the scrimmage;
and as we hadn't much time to spare, we
didn't dig a hole more'n a foot or two deep,

and put all our fellers in, in a hurry. Next
morning airly, as I was just coming out of a
church where I'd ben surveyin' some candle-stix
with a jack-knife to see ef they were silver,
[witch they were not,&mdash;hang em!]&mdash;as
I was coming out of the church I felt a feller
punch me in the back&mdash;so I turned round
to hit him back, when I see the feller, as
had stood by me in the ranks the day before,
all covered over with dirt, and mad as a ringtail
hornet.</p>

<p>'Hello!' said I.</p>

<p>'Hello! yourself,' said he. 'I want ter
know what yer went and berried me for,
afore I was killed for?'</p>

<p>I never was so put to for a answer afore
in all my life, 'cause I wanted to spasificate
the feller, so I kind of hemmed, and says I&mdash;'Hm!
the fact was, this dirty little hole of a
town was <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">rayther</span> crowded last night, and I&mdash;just
to please you, yer know&mdash;I lodged
you out there; but I swear I was this minute
going out there to dig you up for breakfuss!'</p>

<p>'If that's so,' said he, 'we won't say no
more 'bout it; but the next time you do it,
don't put a feller in so deep; for I had a
oncommon hard scratch turning up again!'</p>

<p style="text-align: right">H.P.L.</p>
</div>

<p>We are indebted to the same writer
for the following Oriental market-picture&mdash;we
might say scene in a proverb:</p>

<div class="display">
<p>PROVERBIALLY WISE.</p>

<p>ACHMET sat in the bazaar, calmly smoking:
he had said to himself in the early
morning,&mdash;'When I shall have made a hundred
piastres I will shut up shop for the day,
and go home and take it easy, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">al'hamdu lillah</span>!'
Now a hundred piastres in the land
of the faithful, where the sand is and the
palms grow, is equal to a dollar in the land
of Jonathan: and the expression he concluded
his sentence with is equivalent to&mdash;Praise
be to Allah!</p>

<p>Along came a blind fakir begging; then
ACHMET gave him five paras, although his
charity was unseen; neither did he want it to
be seen, for he said to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do good and throw it into the sea&mdash;if
the fishes don't know it, God will.'</p>

<p>And as he handed the poor blind fakir
the small coin, he said to him, in a soothing
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Fa'keer</span>' (which in the Arabic means
poor fellow), 'the nest of a blind bird is
made by Allah.'</p>

<p>Then along came SULIMAN BEY, who
was high in office in the land of Egypt, and
was wealthy, and powerful, and very much
hated and feared. And ACHMET bowed down
before him, and performed obeisance in the
manner of the Turks, touching his own hand
to his lips, his breast, his head:&mdash;and the
SULIMAN BEY went proudly on. Then
ACHMET smiled, and YUSEF, who had a
stall in the bazaar opposite to him, winked
to ACHMET, saying, in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">'Kiss ardently the hands which you can not cut
off:'&mdash;</p>

<p>and they smiled grimly one unto the other.</p>

<p>'Did you hear the music in the Esbekieh
garden yesterday?' asked YUSEF of ACHMET.
'I think it was horrible.'</p>

<p>'It cost nothing to hear it,' quoth ACHMET:
'there was no charge made.'</p>

<p>'<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Aio</span>! true,' answered YUSEF; 'but there
were too many drums; I wouldn't have one
if I were Pacha.'</p>

<p>'Welcome even pitch, if it is gratis.'</p>

<p>'Wanting to make the eyebrows right,
pull out the eyes,' said ACHMET, contentedly.
'And as for your disliking the music,&mdash;A
cucumber being given to a poor man, he
did not accept it because it was crooked!'&mdash;'Come,
let us shut up shop and go to the
mosque. It is fated that we sell no goods to-day.

the grace of Allah we have found repose!'</p>

our last number over again. It is none
the worse, however, for its new coat, as
set forth in</p>

<div class="display">
<p>GETTING AHEAD OF TIME.</p>

<p>'Well now, I declare, this is too bad.
Here it is five minutes past ten and BUDDEN
ain't here. Did anybody ever know that
man to keep an engagement?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the Doctor to the Squire, 'I
knew him to keep one.'</p>

<p>'Let it out,' said the Squire.</p>

<p>'An engagement to get married.'</p>

<p>'Hm!' replied the Squire, looking over
his spectacles with the air of one who had
been deceived. At this moment JERRY
BUDDEN, a jolly-looking, fat, middle-aged
man entered the office quietly and coolly,
having all the air of one who arrived half
an hour before the appointed time of meeting.</p>

<p>'Got ahead of time this morning, any
way,' said Jerry.</p>


<p>'The devil you did!' spoke the Squire,
testily; 'you are seven minutes behind time
this morning; you would be behindhand to-morrow
and next day, and so on as long as
you live. Confound it, Jerry, you make me
mad with your laziness and coolness. Ahead
of time! why look at that watch!'&mdash;Here
the Squire, pulling out a plethoric-looking,
smooth gold watch, about the size of a bran
biscuit, held it affectionately in the palm of
his right hand. 'Look at <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span> watch!'</p>

<p>'Nice watch,' said Jerry, 'very nice
watch. The best of watches will sometimes
get out of order though. How long since
you had it cleaned?'</p>

<p>The Squire looked indignant, and broke
out, 'I've carried that watch more'n thirty
year; I have it cleaned regularly, and it is
always right to a minute, always! It's <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">you</span>
that want regulating.'</p>

<p>'Can't help it,' spoke Jerry; 'I got ahead
of time this morning.'</p>

<p>'Bet you a hat on it,' said the Squire.</p>

<p>'Done!' answered Jerry. And, putting
his hand in his pocket, he deliberately produced
the torn page of an old almanac, and,
pointing to part of an engraving of the man
with an hour-glass, said to the Squire,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hain't I got a Head of Time&mdash;this
morning?'</p>

<p>Jerry now wears a new hat!</p>

<p class="l">'My grandsire,' IBRAM said, while wrath he nursed.</p>
<p class="l">'Who was the next proprietor?' please say.</p>
<p class="l">'My father:' thus the king replied straightway.</p>

<p class="l">'Who hired it then upon your father's death?'</p>

<p>STRIKING TURPENTINE.</p>

<p>Not a bad story that of the physician, who,
vaccinating several medical students, 'performed
the ceremony' for a North Carolinian
from the pitch, tar and turpentine districts.
The lancet entering the latter's arm a little
too deep, owing to the Corn-cracker jerking
his arm through nervousness, one of the medical
students called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Take care there, doctor, if you don't look
out you'll strike turpentine.'</p>

<p>We should have handed this anecdote
over to X., who travels through the Pines,
that he might pronounce on its authenticity.
The following, however, we know
to be true&mdash;on the word of a very <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">spirituelle</span>
dame, long resident in the Old
North State. When the present war
first sent its murmurs over the South,
an old bushman earnestly denied that it
'would ruin everything.' 'Kin it stop
the turpentime from running?' he triumphantly
cried. 'In course not. Then
what difference <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">kin</span> it make to <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">the country</span>?'</p>

<p>The following sketch, 'Hiving the
Bees and what came of it,' from a valued
friend and correspondent in New
Haven, is a humorous and truthful picture
of the old-fashioned rural 'discipline'
once so general and now so rapidly
becoming a thing of the past:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>HIVING BEES AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</p>

<p>When a boy at school in the town of G&mdash;&mdash;

I became acquainted with old Deacon Hubbard
and his wife&mdash;two as good Christian
people as could be found, simple in their
manners and kind-hearted. The deacon
was 'well to do in the world,' having a fine
farm, a pleasant house, and, with his quiet
way of living, apparently everything to
make him comfortable.</p>

<p>He took great delight in raising bees, and
the product of his hives was every year
some hundreds of pounds of honey, for which
there was always a ready market, though he
frequently gave away large quantities among
his neighbors.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, when passing the
place of Deacon Hubbard on my way to
meeting, I saw the deacon in his orchard
near his house, apparently in great trouble

about something in one of his apple trees.
I crossed the road to the fence and called to
him, and asked him what was the matter.
He was a very conscientious man, and would
not do anything on the Lord's day that could
be done on any other; but he cried, 'Oh,
dear! my bees are swarming, and I shall
surely lose them. If I was a young man I
could climb the tree and save them, but I
am too old for that.' I jumped over the
fence, and as I approached him he pointed
to a large dark mass of something suspended
from the limb of an apple tree, which to me
was a singular-looking object, never having
before seen bees in swarming time. I had
great curiosity to see the operation of hiving,
and suggested that perhaps I could help him,
though at the time afraid the bees would
sting me for my trouble. The gratification
to be derived I thought would repay the
risk, and calling to mind some lines I had
heard,&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Softly, gently touch a nettle,</p>
<p class="l">It will sting thee for thy pains;</p>
<p class="l">Grasp it like a man of mettle,</p>
<p class="l">Soft and harmless it remains,&mdash;'</p>
</div>

<div class="display">
<p>I told him that I would assist him. He
assured me that if I could only get a rope
around the limb above and fasten it to the
one on which the bees were, then saw off
that limb and lower it down, he could secure
them without much trouble.</p>

<p>With saw and rope in hand I ascended
the tree, and, after due preparation, severed
the limb and carefully lowered it within the
deacon's reach. I was surprised, and felt repaid
for my trouble, to see with what ease
and unconcern Dea. Hubbard, with his bare
hands, scooped and brushed the swarm of
bees into a sheet he had prepared, and how
readily he got them into a vacant hive.
Many thanks did the deacon proffer me for
my timely assistance, and moreover insisted
on my staying with him to dine. It seemed
to me that I was never in a more comfortable
house, and I am sure I never received a
more cordial greeting than that bestowed
upon me by his venerable spouse.</p>

<p>The place where I boarded with several
other boys was with a widow lady by the
name of White, who was very kind to me,
but who had the misfortune to have had three
husbands, and her daughters did not all revere
the memory of the same father, and
consequently there were oftentimes differences
among them.</p>

<p>For several days after this transaction I
had noticed on the table at our daily meal
a nice dish of honey, an unusual treat, but
to which we boys paid due respect.</p>

<p>My term at school expired, and I went
home to my father's, a distance of some thirty
miles, and assisted him on the farm during
the fall months, employing much of my
leisure time in studying.</p>

<p>My father was a stern, straight-forward
man&mdash;a member of the Orthodox church,
and one who professed to believe in all the
proprieties of life, and endeavored to impress
the same on the minds of his children.</p>

<p>One day, after dinner, he said to me, in
his stern way of speaking,&mdash;'Gilbert, what
kind of scrape did you get into in G&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>For my life I could not tell what I had
been doing, and had but little chance to
think, ere he tossed a letter across the table
and said, 'Read that, and tell me what it
means!' The letter was directed to me,
but he had exercised his right to open and
read it for me. It was from G&mdash;&mdash;, and
signed by the four deacons of the church
there, asking explicit answers to the following
questions:&mdash;1st. Did you help Deacon
Hubbard hive his bees? 2d. If so, did you
receive any remuneration from him for your
services? 3d. Will you state what it was?
You are expected to answer the questions
fully.'</p>

<p>'What have you to say to that, young
man?' said my father, with more than usual
sternness; and I began to think that I had
got into some kind of difficulty.</p>

<p>I told him that I would answer the letter,
so went to my room and wrote, saying that
I <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">did</span> help Deacon Hubbard hive his bees,
and that I <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">had</span> been paid a thousand times
by the many acts of kindness of himself and
wife, and should always feel happy in doing
anything for them that I could.</p>

<p>As my father read this letter I had written,
I noticed a smile on his countenance,
which lasted but an instant, when he said,
'You may send it; but I want to know what
this scrape is, and I will.'</p>

<p>A few days after the reply was sent,
another letter arrived from the four deacons,
stating that I had not been explicit enough
in my answer, and wanted me to say, 1st.
Whether I had helped Deacon Hubbard hive
his bees on Sunday. 2d. Whether I had
ever received from him a large pan of honey
in the comb? 3d. Whether my father was
a member of the church? 4th. Whether he
would give his consent for me to come to

G&mdash;&mdash; on business of great importance if
they would pay my expenses, and how soon
I could come?</p>

<p>It was cold weather, several months after
I left G&mdash;&mdash;, when this letter came to hand,
and I did not fancy a ride of thirty miles at
that time; I however had permission to
promise that I would be there on the first
Monday in May, which was the day of
'General Training,' and a great day at that
period. In my answer to the second letter
I said that I thought I had answered their
first question sufficiently before; and in answer
to the second I would say, that I had
never received any honey from Deacon Hubbard;
to the third, that my father was a
member of the church; and to the fourth,
that I would come there on the day named
above.</p>

<p>The first Monday in May was a bright
and lovely day, and at an early hour I
mounted a horse and started for G&mdash;&mdash;, arriving
there before noon. On my way into
the village I had to pass the house of Deacon
Hubbard, who, knowing that I was expected
that day, was looking for my approach,
and as I drew near the house I saw
his venerable form in the road. It was my
intention to pass his house without being
seen, but that was impossible. He insisted
on my going into the house. His good wife
met me at the door with a cordial greeting,
but, with tearful eyes, said she feared there
was some dreadful trouble in store for me,
for the deacons of the church had been watching
for me all the morning. After explaining
as well as I could the reason of my visit,
with the little information I had, Deacon
Hubbard exclaimed&mdash;'Well, I don't know
but they'll make you walk the church aisle,
for there's some trouble somewhere.' We
had but little time for conversation before
Mrs. H. saw the venerable deacons approaching
the house; and I shall never forget
the solemn look and steps with which
they advanced, the senior deacon, Flagg,
leading the procession. As they were ushered
into the front room they seated themselves
in a row according to their respective
ages, each wearing the solemn countenance
of a Pilgrim father. When I entered the
room they all arose and took me by the
hand, thanking me for faithfully keeping
my promise, and hoped the Lord would reward
me therefor. Deacon Flagg, after a
few preliminary remarks, said: 'Young man,
there has been a grievous sin committed
among the Lord's anointed in our church,
and we have sent for you that we may be
enabled to detect the erring one! and we
hope you will so far consider the importance
of the matter as to answer truly the questions
that may be propounded to you. My
young friend, will you have the goodness to
say, in the hearing of our good brother, Deacon
Hubbard, whether or not you ever received
from him a present of a large pan of
honey for helping him hive his bees?'</p>

<p>I answered that I never had. All eyes
were turned on Deacon H., and an audible
groan came from Deacon Harris as I made
my reply. Deacon Flagg addressed me as
follows:&mdash;'My youthful friend, will you be
willing to accompany these gentlemen to
the house of sister White, and say the same
before her?' I was willing, provided my
friend Deacon Hubbard would go along,
which he consented to do, and we started.</p>

<p>It was but a short way across the Common,
and ours was a solemn, silent procession,
and I must have appeared like a very
culprit. On nearing the house, Deacon Flagg
said he would first enter and inform sister
White of our business, and return when she
was ready to receive us. He returned in a
short time, with a longer face than before,
and as he approached us, clasping his hands,
he said with an agonized tone, 'Dear brethren,
Oh! it is all too true! Satan entered
her heart,&mdash;she coveted the honey,&mdash;and
fell.' A groan of holy horror came from all
the good old men. It was not necessary for
us to enter the abode of wickedness, he said,
for she would confess all.</p>

<p>The whole proceeding had been a mystery
to me, but I soon learned that the next
day after hiving the bees, Deacon Hubbard
had sent a large pan of honey to sister
White's house, intended for me, but she
gave us boys a little for a few days and put
the rest away; or, as she afterwards said,
she coveted it, and said nothing to me about
it; and I should probably have known nothing
of it had it not been for a disagreement
between herself and daughters about a division
of the honey, which finally got to be
a church matter.</p>

<p>Deacon Hubbard insisted on my going
to dine with him; so, with a parting shake of
the hand with the other four venerable men,
we started for his house. Such a feast as
dame Hubbard had provided on that occasion
boys do not often see; substantial food
enough for half a score of men, aside from

the pies and plum pudding which made
their appearance in due course; and in front
of the dish assigned to me was a dish of the
purest honey. After dinner Deacon Hubbard
took me to see his bees, and explained
many things in relation to them curious and
instructive, promising more information on
the subject if he could prevail upon me to
remain in G&mdash;&mdash; till the next morning. The
fatigue of the long ride that day, and my desire
to see a little of the 'Training,' decided
me to remain over night.</p>

<p>In the morning my horse was fresh, having
been well taken care of by my friend; so,
after a hearty breakfast, I bade adieu to the
good couple, with a pleasant recollection of
their hospitality and kindness. When ready
to start, dame Hubbard, with the best intentions,
brought me a large pail of honey,
wishing I would carry it home to my parents,
but as it was impossible for me to carry
it on horseback, I had to decline.</p>

<p>It was near noon the next day when I
reached home, and my first greeting from
my father was, 'Well, Gilbert, now let me
know about the scrape you got into last
summer in G&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>I told him all I had learned about the matter,
to which be expressed his pleasure that
it was no worse, and gave me much good
advice as to the future.</p>

<p>A few weeks after I readied home there
was a large tub of honey left at my father's
house, with a letter for me, informing me
that sister White had been expelled from
the church in G&mdash;&mdash; for covetousness; that
my friends the Hubbards were well; that
the four deacons spoke very highly in my
praise, and hoped I would <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">feel rewarded</span> for
the trouble I had taken. Years have passed
since the matters here mentioned took place,
but up to this time nothing has been said to
me about 'paying my expenses.'</p>

<p>I have a proposition to make.</p>

<p>Let General McCLELLAN send a flag of

seceders have no time to ignite the weed, we
are quite ready, and a great deal more willing,
considering the late frightful rise in
Lynchburg, to do it for them. I can answer
for burning one pound a day myself. What
do you think of it? It isn't traitorous in me,
is it, to thus desire to aid and assist the enemy?</p>

<p>A CURE FOR STEALING.</p>

<div class="lg">

<p class="l">Far back among the days of yore</p>
<p class="l">There's many a pleasing tale in store,</p>
<p class="l">Rich with the humor of the time,</p>
<p class="l">That sometimes jingle well in rhyme.</p>
<p class="l">Of these, the following may possess</p>
<p class="l">A claim on 'hours of idleness.'</p>
<p class="l">When Governor Gurdon Saltonstall,</p>
<p class="l">Like Abram Lincoln, straight and tall,</p>

<p class="l">Presided o'er the Nutmeg State,</p>
<p class="l">A loved and honored magistrate,</p>
<p class="l">His quiet humor was portrayed</p>
<p class="l">In Yankee tricks he sometimes played.</p>
<p class="l">The Governor had a serious air,</p>
<p class="l">'Twas solemn as a funeral prayer,</p>
<p class="l">But when he spoke the mirth was stirred,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">A joke leaped out at every word.</p>

<p class="l">One morn, a man, alarmed and pale,</p>
<p class="l">Came to him with a frightful tale;</p>
<p class="l">The substance was, that Jerry Style</p>
<p class="l">Had <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">stolen wood</span> from off his pile.</p>
<p class="l">The Governor started in surprise,</p>
<p class="l">And on the accuser fixed his eyes.</p>
<p class="l">'He steal my wood! to his regret,</p>

<p class="l">Before this blessed sun shall set,</p>
<p class="l">I'll put a final end to <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">that</span>.'</p>
<p class="l">Then, putting on his stately hat,</p>
<p class="l">All nicely cocked and trimmed with lace,</p>
<p class="l">He issued forth with lofty grace,</p>

<p class="l">Bade the accuser; duty mind,'</p>
<p class="l">And follow him 'five steps <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">behind</span>.'</p>

<p class="l">Ere they a furlong's space complete,</p>
<p class="l">They meet the culprit in the street;</p>
<p class="l">The Governor took him by the hand&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">That lowly man! that Governor grand!&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Kindly inquired of his condition,</p>
<p class="l">His present prospects and position.</p>
<p class="l">The man a tale of sorrow told&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">That food was dear, the winter cold,</p>

<p class="l">That work was scarce, and times were hard,</p>
<p class="l">And very ill at home they fared,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">And, more than this, a bounteous Heaven</p>
<p class="l">To them a little babe had given,</p>
<p class="l">Whose brief existence could attest</p>
<p class="l">This world's a wintry world at best.</p>
<p class="l">A silver crown, whose shining face</p>
<p class="l">King William's head and Mary's grace,</p>

<p class="l">Dropped in his hand. The Governor spoke,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">His voice was cracked&mdash;it almost broke,&mdash;'If</p>
<p class="l">work is scarce, and times are hard,</p>
<p class="l">There's a <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">large wood-pile in my yard;</span></p>
<p class="l"><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Of that you may most freely use,</span></p>
<p class="l"><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">So go and get it when you choose</span>.'</p>

<p class="l">Then on he walked, serenely feeling</p>
<p class="l">That there he'd put an end to stealing.</p>
<p class="l">The accuser's sense of duty grew</p>
<p class="l">The space 'twixt him and Governor too.</p>

</div>

<br />

<p>The present aspect of the great question
is well set forth by a correspondent,
'LEILA LEE,' in the following
sketch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>OUR OLD PUMP.</p>

<p>The writer was once placed in circumstances
of peculiar interest, where a word in
season was greatly needed, and that word
was not spoken, because it would have been
thought unseemly that it should fall from
the lips of a woman. Our supply of water
had failed. The well was deep, and, like
Jacob's well, many had been in the habit of
coming thither to draw. My father had called
in advisers, men of experience, and they
decided that the lower part of the pump was
rotten, and must be removed. It had probably
stood there more than fifty years, and
had been so useful in its day, that it was
like an old and familiar friend.</p>

<p>The work was commenced, and all the
family stood by the closed window, the children's

faces pressed close to the glass, as with
eager eyes we all watched the heavy machinery
erected over the old well. A mother
came out of a neighboring house, and stood
with a babe in her arms to see the work. A
large rope was firmly placed around the pump,
and made fast to the derrick. Then came
the tug of war, and with a long pull, a
strong pull, and a pull all together, the wooden
pump rose up gradually from its hiding-place
of years.</p>

<p>'Oh, mother! mother!' I exclaimed; 'see,
the derrick is not long enough to raise the
pump out of the well! Why don't they
saw it off, and take out the old pump in two
or three pieces?'</p>

<p>Just then papa screamed to Mrs. Rice,
'Run out of the way, quick, with your baby!'</p>

<p>There stood all the workmen in dismay.
What was to be done? My father had no
idea that he had undertaken such a tremendous
job, and now he was in great perplexity.
Who, indeed, could have believed that
the well was deep enough to hold a pump
of such immense size as this, that had become
so old and rotten? Oh, for ropes
longer and stronger! Oh, for muscle and
nerve! Oh, for men of herculean strength
to meet this terrible crisis! At that moment,
a timely suggestion, from any quarter, would
have been welcome. But, even then, it
might have been too late; for the pump
fell with a tremendous crash, carrying with
it all the machinery. Papa fell upon the
ground, but the derrick had safely passed
over him, prostrating the fences, and endangering
the lives of the workmen.</p>

<p>This scene, which was soon almost forgotten,
is recalled by the fearful crisis that
is now upon us. While we rejoice in our
recent victories, and believe that this wicked
rebellion will soon be subdued, we must rejoice
with trembling, so long as SLAVERY,
the acknowledged <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">casus belli</span>, still remains.
The unsightly monster, in all its rottenness
and deformity, is drawn up from the hiding-place
of ages, and it can no more be restored
to its former <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">status</span>, than, at the will of the
workmen, our old pump could be thrust back,
when, suspended in the air, it threatened their
destruction. God forbid that our rulers
should desire it! What, then, is to be done?
No giant mind has yet been found to grapple
successfully with this great evil&mdash;no
body of men who can concentrate a moral
power sufficient to remove this worn-out system,
without endangering some interest of
vital importance to our beloved country.</p>

<p>Zion must now lengthen her cords and
strengthen her stakes, for the wisdom of the
wise has become foolishness, that God alone
may be exalted. He will surely bring down
every high thought, and every vain imagination,
and his own people must learn what
it is 'to receive the kingdom of God as little
children.' How shall liberty be proclaimed
throughout the length and breadth of the
land, to all the inhabitants thereof, and, in
obedience to the will of God, this year become
a year of jubilee to the poor and oppressed
of our nation? How shall the
emancipation of slavery conduce to the best
interest of the master, no less than to the
happiness of the slave?</p>

<p>Probably some very simple solution will
be given to this question, in answer to the
earnest cry of God's people. Should it
please him to hide this thought for the crisis
from the wise and prudent, and reveal
it unto babes, God grant that it may be in
our hearts to respond, 'Even so, Father, for
so it seemeth good in thy sight.'</p>
</div>

<br />

<p>The simple solution has already been
begun by our Executive, in recognizing
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">principle</span>&mdash;its extraordinary advance
among all classes will soon fully develop
it. In illustration of this we quote
a letter which the editor of the New Haven
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Journal and Courier</span> vouches to
come from an officer in the navy, known
to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>From what we see and know of the operations
of the rebels in this part of the South
(the Southern coast, where he has been stationed),
and from what we see perfidious
Englishmen doing for the rebels, we are fast
becoming strong abolitionists. We feel that
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">now</span> Slavery must receive its death-blow, and
be destroyed forever from the country. You
would be surprised to see the change going
on in the minds of officers in our service, who
have been great haters of abolitionists; and
the Southerners in our navy are the most
bitter toward those who have made slavery
the great cause of war. They freely express
the opinion that the whole system must be
abolished, and even our old captain, who is
a native of Tennessee, and who has hitherto
insisted that the abolitionists of the North
brought on this war, said last night, 'If England
continues to countenance the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">institution</span>,

I hope our government will put arms in the
hands of the slaves, and that slavery will now
be the destruction of the whole South, or of
the rebels in the South.' He further said,
'The slave-holder has, by the tacit consent
and aid of England, brought on the most
unjustifiable, iniquitous and barbarous war
ever known in the history of the world.'</p>
</div>

<p>Too far and too fast&mdash;it is not Abolition,
or the good of the black, but Emancipation,
or the benefit of the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">white</span> man,
which is really progressing so rapidly
with the American people. But whatever
causes of agitation are at work,
whether on limited or general principles
of philanthropy and political economy,
one thing is at least certain&mdash;the day
of the triumph of free labor is dawning,
while the cause of progress</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">'Careers with thunder speed along!'</p>
</div>

<p>It is almost a wonder that the late offer
of the king of Siam to stock this
land with elephants was not jumped at,
when one remembers the American national
fondness for the animal, and how
copiously our popular orators and poets
allude to a sight of the monster. Among
the latest elephantine tales which we
have encountered is the following, from
our New Haven correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Dr. H., of this pleasant city of Elms, has
been noted for many years for always driving
the gentlest and most sober, but at the
same time the most fearfully 'homely' of
horses. His steeds will always stand wherever
he pleases to leave them, but they have
rather a venerable and woful aspect, that
renders them anything but pleasant objects
to the casual observer. A few years ago
there came a caravan to town, and several
horses were badly frightened by the elephants,
so that quite a number of accidents
took place. A day or two after, old Dr.
Knight met Dr. H., and speaking of the accidents,
Dr. Knight remarked that he had
not dared to take his horse out while the
procession was passing through the streets.
'Oh, ho!' said Dr. H., 'why, I took my
mare and drove right up alongside of them,
and she wasn't the least bit scared!'</p>

<p>'Hum&mdash;yes,' says Dr. K., '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">but how did
the elephant stand it</span>?'</p>
</div>

<p>By particular request we find room for
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>Hon. &mdash;&mdash; then read his Poem entitled
the 'Boulder,' which must be heard before
we can form an idea of the genius of
the poet. First we are reminded of the
style of the sweet songs of Pherimorz as his
enchanting strains fell upon the enraptured
soul of the fair Lady of the Lake. Then
away, on painted wings of gratified imagination,
is the mind carried to the zephyr wooings
of the dying sunset, over the elevated
brow of the dark Maid of the Forest, as she
reclines upon her couch of eagles' feathers,
and down from angles wings, hearing the
last whisper of the falling echo from the
world of sound.</p>

<p>Whether the wild chaos of storm and
whirlwind which madly raged over the benighted
earth before 'light was,' rushed to
the dark caverns where the fettered earthquake
lay, when order was demanded by
the Father of Lights, we can not tell; but
surely it is a pleasing thought for the mind
engulfed in the unfathomed darkness of uncreated
light, to be brought out and suffered
to rest on the peaceful bosom of the new
creation. Whether 'the world that then
was' was overflown and perished by the
causes set forth, we can not tell. We regret
that we can not now give a more extended
and particular notice of this poem; let us
hope that ere long we may enjoy the delight
of reading its printed form.</p>
</div>

<p>That must indeed have been a poem
which could inspire <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">such</span> poetry in others.</p>

<br />

<p>The Boston <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Courier</span> published, over
the signature of 'MIDDLESEX,' during
the months of February and March, a
number of articles entitled, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Through the
Gulf States</span>. So far as we have examined
and compared the series, it appears
to be a literal reprint, with a few trivial
alterations of dates and statistics, of
the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Letters from the Gulf States</span>, originally
published in the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Knickerbocker
New York Monthly Magazine</span>, in 1847.</p>

<p>THE KNICKERBOCKER</p>

<p>FOR 1862.</p>


<p>In the beginning of the last year, when its present proprietors assumed
control of the Knickerbocker, they announced their determination to
spare no pains to place it in its true position as the leading
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">literary</span> Monthly in America. When rebellion had raised a successful
front, and its armies threatened the very existence of the Republic, it
was impossible to permit a magazine, which in its circulation reached
the best intellects in the land, to remain insensible or indifferent to
the dangers which threatened the Union. The proprietors accordingly gave
notice, that it would present in its pages, forcible expositions with
regard to the great question of the times,&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">how to preserve the</span> UNITED
STATUS OF AMERICA <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">in their integrity and unity</span>. How far this pledge
has been redeemed the public must judge. It would, however, be mere
affectation to ignore the seal of approbation which has been placed on
these efforts. The proprietors gratefully acknowledge this, and it has
led them to embark in a fresh undertaking, as already announced,&mdash;the
publication of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, devoted to Literature and
National Policy; in which magazine, those who have sympathized with the
political opinions recently set forth in the KNICKERBOCKER, will find
the same views more fully enforced and maintained by the ablest and most
energetic minds in America.</p>

<p>The KNICKERBOCKER, while it will continue firmly pledged to the cause of
the Union, will henceforth be more earnestly devoted to literature, and
will leave no effort untried to attain the highest excellence in those
departments of letters which it has adopted as specialties.</p>

<p>The January number commences its thirtieth year. With such antecedents
as it possesses, it seems unnecessary to make any especial pledges as to
its future, but it may not be amiss to say that it will be the aim of
its conductors to make it more and more deserving of the liberal support
it has hitherto received. The same eminent writers who have contributed
to it during the past year will continue to enrich its pages, and in
addition, contributions will appear from others of the highest
reputation, as well as from many rising authors. While it will, as
heretofore, cultivate the genial and humorous, it will also pay
assiduous attention to the higher departments of art and letters, and
give fresh and spirited articles on such biographical, historical,
scientific, and general subjects as are of especial interest to the
public.</p>

<p>In the January issue will commence a series of papers by CHARLES GODFREY
LELAND, entitled "SUNSHINE IN LETTERS," which will be found interesting
to scholars as well as to the general reader, and in an early number
will appear the first chapters of a NEW and INTERESTING NOVEL,
descriptive of American life and character.</p>

<p>According to the unanimous opinion of the American press, the
KNICKERBOCKER has been greatly improved during the past year, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">and it is
certain that at no period of its long career did it ever attract more
attention or approbation</span>. Confident of their enterprise and ability,
the proprietors are determined that it shall be still more eminent in
excellence, containing all that is best of the old, and being
continually enlivened by what is most brilliant of the new.</p>

<p>TERMS.&mdash;Three dollars a year, in advance. Two copies for Four Dollars
and fifty cents. Three copies for Six dollars. Subscribers remitting

<p>PROSPECTUS</p>

<p>OF</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-weight: bold;">The Continental Monthly.</span></p>


<p>There are periods in the world's history marked by extraordinary and
violent crises, sudden as the breaking forth of a volcano, or the
bursting of a storm on the ocean. These crises sweep away in a moment
the landmarks of generations. They call out fresh talent, and give to
the old a new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new
theories developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for
expounders.</p>

<p>This Continent has lately been convulsed by an upheaving so sudden and
terrible that the relations of all men and all classes to each other are
violently disturbed, and people look about for the elements with which
to sway the storm and direct the whirlwind. Just at present, we do not
know what all this is to bring forth; but we do know that great results
MUST flow from such extraordinary commotions.</p>

<p>At a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that
the intellectual force of the country should be active and efficient. It
is a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take
position as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want
unsupplied. It is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open
to the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the issues
presented, and to be presented to the country, in a tone no way tempered
by partisanship, or influenced by fear, favor, or the hope of reward;
which shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the
present disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN
NOT be laid aside or neglected.</p>

<p>To meet this want, the undersigned have commenced, under the editorial
charge of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the publication of a new Magazine,
devoted to Literature and National Policy.</p>

<p>In POLITICS, it will advocate, with all the force at its command,
measures best adapted to preserve the oneness and integrity of these
United States. It will never yield to the idea of any disruption of this
Republic, peaceably or otherwise; and it will discuss with honesty and
impartiality what must be done to save it. In this department, some of
the most eminent statesmen of the time will contribute regularly to its
pages.</p>

<p>In LITERATURE, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest
thinkers of this country.</p>

<p>Among its attractions will be presented, in an early number, a NEW
SERIAL of American Life, by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, ESQ., the very popular
author of "The Revelations of Wall Street," "St. Leger," &amp;c. A series of
papers by HON. HORACE GREELEY, embodying the distinguished author's
observations on the growth and development of the Great West. A series
of articles by the author of "Through the Cotton States," containing the
result of an extended tour in the seaboard Slave States, just prior to
the breaking out of the war, and presenting a startling and truthful
picture of the real condition of that region. No pains will be spared to
render the literary attractions of the CONTINENTAL both brilliant and
substantial. The lyrical or descriptive talents of the most eminent
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">literati</span> have been promised to its pages; and nothing will be admitted
which will not be distinguished by marked energy, originality, and solid
strength. Avoiding every influence or association partaking of clique or
coterie, it will be open to all contributions of real merit, even from
writers differing materially in their views; the only limitation
required being that of devotion to the Union, and the only standard of
acceptance that of intrinsic excellence.</p>

<p>The EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT will embrace, in addition to vigorous and
fearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the
reader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those
racy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be no
perfect exposition of our national character. Among those who will
contribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of
CHARLES F. BROWNE ("Artemus Ward"), from whom we have promised an
entirely new and original series of SKETCHES OF WESTERN LIFE.</p>

<p>The CONTINENTAL will be liberal and progressive, without yielding to
chimeras and hopes beyond the grasp of the age; and it will endeavor to
reflect the feelings and interests of the American people, and to
illustrate both their serious and humorous peculiarities. In short, no
pains will be spared to make it the REPRESENTATIVE MAGAZINE of the time.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-weight: bold;">TERMS:</span>&mdash;Three Dollars per year, in advance (postage paid by the
Publishers;) Two Copies for Five Dollars; Three Copies for Six Dollars,
(posture unpaid); Eleven copies for Twenty Dollars, (postage unpaid).
Single numbers can be procured of any News-dealer in the United States.
The KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE and the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY will be furnished
for one year at FOUR DOLLARS.</p>

<p>Appreciating the importance of literature to the soldier on duty, the
publisher will send the CONTINENTAL, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">gratis</span>, to any regiment in active
service, on application being made by its Colonel or Chaplain; he will
also receive subscriptions from those desiring to furnish it to soldiers
in the ranks at half the regular price; but in such cases it must be
mailed from the office of publication.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-weight: bold;">J.R. GILMORE, 110 Tremont Street, Boston.</span></p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-weight: bold;">CHARLES T. EVANS, at G.P. PUTNAM'S, 532 Broadway, New York,
is authorized to receive Subscriptions in that City.</span></p>

<dt><a name="note_1">1.</a></dt><dd><p>An incident that occurred at Palmyra, in
Marion County, of which the writer was a witness,
may be given as a fair illustration of Benton's
insulting and insufferable manner in this
celebrated canvass. During the delivery of his
speech, in the densely-crowded court-house,
a prominent county politician, who was opposed
to Benton, arose and put a question to
him. 'Come here,' said Benton, in his abrupt
and authoritative tone. The man with difficulty
made his way through the mass, and advanced
till he stood immediately in front of
Benton. 'Who are you, sir?' inquired the
swelling and indignant senator. The citizen
gave his well-known name. 'Who?' demanded
Benton. The name was distinctly repeated.
And then, without replying to the question
that had been proposed, but with an air of disdain
and annihilating contempt that no man in
America but Benton could assume, he proceeded
with his speech, leaving his interrogator to
retire from his humiliating embarrassment as
best he could. At the close of the address,
some of his friends expressed surprise to Benton
that he had not known the man that interrupted
him. 'Know him!' said he; 'I knew
him well enough. I only meant to make him
stand with his hat in his hand, and tell me his
name, like a nigger.'</p></dd><dt><a name="note_2">2.</a></dt><dd><p>See Historical Mag., Vol. 4, p. 230.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_3">3.</a></dt><dd><p>Among the cotton lately arrived from Port
Royal was a number of bales marked with the
form of a coffin. It was the growth of 'Coffin's
Island,' which is usually of the highest
grade.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_4">4.</a></dt><dd><p>The palmetto is a straight, tall tree, with a
tuft of branches and palm leaves at its top.
The new growth is the centre as it first expands
somewhat resembles a cabbage. It is
often used for boiling and pickling. The wood
of the tree is spongy, and is used for building
wharves, as it is impervious to the sea-worm.
It is said that a cannon ball will not penetrate
it. It is a paltry emblem for a State flag, as its
characteristics accurately indicate pride and
poverty. When used for wharves, it, however,
becomes a veritable '<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Mudsill</span>.'</p></dd><dt><a name="note_5">5.</a></dt><dd><p>Before 1700 a colony from Dorchester, Mass.,
made a settlement on Ashley River, and named
it for their native town; afterwards, they sent
an offshoot and planted the town of Midway, in
Georgia. For more than a century they kept
up their Congregational Church, with many of
their New England institutions. Their descendants
in both States have been famed for their
enterprise, industry, and moral qualities down
to the present day.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_6">6.</a></dt><dd><p>The Barnwells can trace their pedigree back
about one hundred and fifty years to a Col.
Barnwell who commanded in an Indian war.
Subsequently the name appears on the right
side in the Revolution. This is a long period
to trace ancestry in Carolina; for while nearly
all New England families can trace back to
the Puritans, more than two hundred years,
the lordly Carolinians generally get among the

'mudsills' in three or four generations at the
farthest.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_7">7.</a></dt><dd><p>Some thirty years ago, R. Barnwell Smith
made a figure in Congress by his ultra nullification
speeches, and was then considered the
greatest fire-eater of them all. He was not 'to
the manor born,' but was the son of a Gen.
Smith, who founded and resided in the small
and poverty-stricken town of Smithville, N.C.,
at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. As his
paternal fortune was small, and some family
connection existed with the Barnwells, he emigrated
to Beaufort, and there practiced as a
lawyer. He was followed by two brothers,
who had the same profession. He was the
first who openly advocated secession in Congress.
They have all been leading politicians
and managers of the Charleston <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Mercury</span>,
which, by its mendacity and constant abuse of
the North, and its everlasting laudations of
Southern wealth and power, has done much to
bring on the present war.</p>

<p>Desirous to stand better with the aristocracy,
some years ago the family sunk the plebeian
patronymic of Smith and adopted that of Rhett,
a name known in South Carolina a century previous.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_8">8.</a></dt><dd><p>During Nullification times the Fullers were
Union men. Doctor Thomas Fuller, who, a
short time since, set fire to his buildings and
cotton crop to prevent their falling into Yankee
hands, is well known as a kind-hearted physician,
and better things might have been expected
of him.</p>

<p>His brother is a celebrated Baptist clergyman
in Baltimore. He was formerly a lawyer,
and afterwards preached to an immense congregation,
mainly of slaves, in his native place.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_9">9.</a></dt><dd><p>Many years ago the Elliots were staunch
Union men, and Stephen Elliot, a gentleman of
talent, wrote many very able arguments against
nullification and in favor of the Union. He always
thought that Port Royal must some day
be the great naval and commercial depot of the
South. He may yet live to see his former anticipations
realized, though not in the way he
desired.</p></dd><dt><a name="note_10">10.</a></dt><dd><p>An Inquiry laid by me it few years ago before

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
